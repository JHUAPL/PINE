 I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,
the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is 
all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.

Thanks,

well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after
starting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a
new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...

i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch
of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:

* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook
introductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an
appearence ""this summer"" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i
don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had
more info...

* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the
ones the duo's just went through recently?

* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing
a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have
a feel for how much ""better"" the display is (yea, it looks great in the
store, but is that all ""wow"" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit
some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize
this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).

* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)

thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a
summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the
corner... :( )

My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.

I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass
destruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.
The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be
allowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to
consider another class.

ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.
SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 
By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on 
sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as 
mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip
an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s,
10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.

Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.
One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is 
(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,
but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,
the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this
from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.

Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the
Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between
YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral
Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall, though.

As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was
required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that
the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).

The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between
Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate
anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).

The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created
in His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if
one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors
unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about
Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.
Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.

This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way
initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible
to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where
Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.

>
>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no
>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.

No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is if
the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate""
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but
you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and
""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""

Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in
today's Times).

Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting
the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this
option are:
  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C
     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force.
  -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle
     flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.
     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for 30 day missions.
  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.
  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and
     add another 20 kW of power
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,
     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle).

Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we
have all come to know and love :)

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the 
number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,
for both options ""A"" and ""B"".

The build-up occurs in six phases:
  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when
     it visits.
  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist
     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is
     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by
     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).
  -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,
     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal
     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.
  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,
     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in 24 flights.

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, 
with the exception of the data management system, which has major
changes.

Option C - Single Core Launch Station.
This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter
cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on
the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a 
regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:
  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout
  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against
    micrometeroid & orbital debris)
  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)
  - 7 berthing ports
  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet
    (twice the volume of skylab).
  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors
  - 10 kW of housekeeping power
  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal
    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)
  - increased crew time for utilization
  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module

Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during
World War II.  If you're prepared to say ""Let's round these people up and
stick them in a concentration camp without trial"", it's only a short step to
gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally
only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly
because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation
caused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of
malnutrition or disease.

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works
very well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it
because of its complexity.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF
images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.

As the saying goes, ""It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the
>other<  assholes out there!""  I've had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and
unnecessary) complexity of the format.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized
emphasis mine):

""The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),
and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be
able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many
image-generating applications out there now.""


If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF
image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to
deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not
that anyone does, of course! :-)

     I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male
drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here's a summary of
the replies I received.
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).
 
1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model).
No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1,
airbag, abs, security alarm, single.
 
$1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100
for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base
policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.
 
After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.
 
I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had
and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.
 
Hope this helps.

    (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...
 
    You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year
    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the
    same inquiry as you.
 
    Age: 24 (then and now)
    Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD
    Driving Record: Clean
    State: Illinois
    Cost: $820/6 mos.
 
    I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.
    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.
 
    I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more
    than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.
 
    Hope the info helps.

one for going 35 in a 25 (which didn't go on my record)). My rates
from State Farm (with a passive restraint deduction) on liability,

======================================================================== 61
 
I am beyond the ""under 25"" age group, but I have an experience a few
years ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica
GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners
included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).
I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling
(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less
money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury
car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.
I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i
decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked
about what would happen to my rate with either car.
 
""If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as
the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that
year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because
the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue
to handle your account.
 
""If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard
[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with
a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,
but cancel you after that.""
 
""But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually
faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.""
 
 That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For
some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -
as very traditional and conservative.""
 
I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche
dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure
guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken
a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I
concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto
theft.

I live in Idaho.  When I was <26 many years ago (10 years) I bought a Trans
Am (new).  Insurance was about $1300/year.  When I turned 26, it immediately
dropped to $460/year.  I had not had any accidents before or after, this was
strictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I
sold the car 2 years ago.  My F-150 pickup is about $80/year less.
 
The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age 25, I felt SO MUCH MORE

Mass,
 
	One thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in.
I'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance
of Boston.  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about
$1150, if I moved to the worst it would be $2000+..

I have a 1990 Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd, am 23 years old and have no
tickets that went on my record.  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago
and pay $1560 a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small
discount because of my alarm system($30 a year).  I only live 15 miles from
Chicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about $2000
a year.

I'm over 25, but in case you're interested anyway, I'm insuring a 93 SHO
for $287/6 month.  Thats 100k personal+300k total+100k property with
250 deductible, glass and towing, State Farm.
 
======================================================================== 39
 
Unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5
years, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I don't have
one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is
clean, then you should not be paying over $2K.
 
Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?
Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that
most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high
quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.
 
Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at
renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low
rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance
companies 8^).
 
Good luck,

I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this.
It does have tons of qool stuff in it. 
My impression is that they try not to send it out to ""browsers"". It
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to

       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the
way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,
rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal 
pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".  

       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is 
purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.

Yes.

(I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service.
Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack
environmentalism)

A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will
rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more
powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.

Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something
other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the
health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You
think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,
it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is
not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is
God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.

I see two facets of a response to it:

1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is
   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because
   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not
   constitute what the Apostle Paul called ""becoming all things to all men so
   that by all possible means I might save some.""

   Don't say ""Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time
   on."" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your
   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.

2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not
   creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and
   glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords
   woven in the infinite tapestry.

It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying ""unsafe"" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial
numbers do catch theives.

Just a thought,
Michael

My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I

enough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to
get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a
doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the
chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil
is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His
father was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate
into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about
their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd
malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from
acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort
of teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a

make the condition worse, not better.

How do you define war?  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?
January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold
               1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,
                    after cutting off the supply lines to it.
Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.
By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from
      land links with the rest of the Jewish population.
         The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,
            while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were
            slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.
Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from
     Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
     of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews 
     had been killed.

Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.
Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?
Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?

Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect
of:

seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  What's also neat is
Chevaldae's in Detroit; they call him ""Chevy"" so he has two checkered flags

I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as
providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far
as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal
of letting LE wiretap ""terrorists and drug dealers"" is to restrict
stronger techniques.  

Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or
(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be
tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption
class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the
introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong
privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system
expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The
mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.

The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping
capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic
cryptography, and only by this restriction.  ""Clipper"" appears to be
no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We
would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public
at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but
most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses
the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who
wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about
cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be
labeled ""too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need"".

What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will
continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul
law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other
grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They
could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the
hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your
case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most
likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was
required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute
unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a
textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away
with it.

Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those

redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.

Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for
example are quite safe to carry this way.

Agreed.

Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On
the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high
primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.
An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.

I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from
turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.

Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely
to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.
The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category.

Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's ""The Semi
Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.""

In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm.

Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department
isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their
own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.

For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day
and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!

That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a
Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok
too!)

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game
with California was cancelled.

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?

One question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered
from Scripture.  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.

There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial. 
Answer this:

Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical
basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial?
OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to
Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been
annulled?  References please.

If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to
Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now
grafted into the commonwealth of Israel?

Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish
between ""health"" and ""treatment of disease."" All the prevention
medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.
You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough

That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen 
M. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the 
Armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish 
women, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia 
in June 1919 that

""the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist
 and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys
 of whatever power happened to be ascendent.""

In September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of
Military Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs:

""...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory
 allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim.""[1]

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to
""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets
the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport""
mode entail?  several things:

1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)

2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the
	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching)

3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is
	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.

also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a
5 speed)?  

how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will
be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high
revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to
    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.


    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron
    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro
    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based
    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.

    1993 Missions
	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]
	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform
	    a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray
	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search
	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white
	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also
	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos
	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development
	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch
	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]
	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.

	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]
	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.

	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]
	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.

	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]
	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be
	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and
	    engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and
	    retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.

    1994
	o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]
	    June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the
	    Earth.

	o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]
	    International Microgravity Laboratory.

	o ADEOS [NASDA]
	    Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.

	o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]
	    Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure
	    and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.

    1995
	LUNAR-A [ISAS]
	    Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the
	    moon's interior.


    Proposed Missions:
	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)
	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space
	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for
	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.

	o Earth Observing System (EOS)
	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to
	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science
	    including planetary evolution.

	o Mercury Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch.

	o Lunar Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
	    orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
	    results from the Apollo program.

	o Space Infrared Telescope Facility
	    Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
	    the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with
	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic
	    birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant
	    infrared-emitting galaxies

	o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)
	    Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and
	    surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for
	    imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.

	o Fire and Ice
	    Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of
	    Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in
	    2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice
	    components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking
	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
	    vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out
	    towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.

Does anyone know of a program which doesn't require an X extension?  Most

Any help would be appreciated.

First of all, infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans
to explain certain things in a certain way. We don't know if it actually
applies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite.

You don't know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another
mathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain
way.

I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It's a man-made concept, and
like many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had
a different understanding of it.

Precicely. We don't even know if infinity applies to reality.

Wow, the scope of the mission of the ATF continues to expand.  Besides

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because
of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for
other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy
and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were
killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions 
lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,
peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to
mind...

I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers
of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally
intended for.

That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is
just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in
the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in
religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many
people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own
stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to
kill by their leaders.

The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often
lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant
side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching
between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  

@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest
parts of Man's history.@

Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological
social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.
The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups
with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to
further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these
were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious
persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more
powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples
because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over
religion that he does not have many choices.

Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of
little silver butter-dishes.

""Within a few months after the war began, these Armenian guerrilla
 forces, operating in close coordination with the Russians, were
 savagely attacking Turkish cities, towns and villages in the east,
 massacring their inhabitants without mercy, while at the same time
 working to sabotage the Ottoman army's war effort by destroying roads
 and bridges, raiding caravans, and doing whatever else they could to
 ease Russian occupation. The atrocities committed by the Armenian 
 volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the 
 Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the 
 fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of many
 Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with 
 accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian 
 guerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of
 war then observed in such areas.[1]""

Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I 
am writing. By the way, that ""bullshit"" is justly regarded as the first 
instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.
For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived 
on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet 
and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The 
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its 
Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, 
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey
 when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have 
 been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every 
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily 
 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate..."" 

He also stated that:

""they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian

 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.""

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration 
camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the
short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the 
cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party 
leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by 
this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia
(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it
had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who
could be expected to oppose their plans. 

On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even 
though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over
60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the 
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left 
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few 
Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British
soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. 

Rawlinson wired to his superiors, 

""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control,
 atrocities were constantly being committed.""

""The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have 
 recently taken over is given below:

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered, have been destroyed,
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the two-year Russian occupation.

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.

 As to the people of these cities:

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people,
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the 
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls
 and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than
 those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,
 horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in
 Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and 
 Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have 
 been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely
 massacred.

 Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions.""

Yo! Watch the attributions--I didn't say that!

Again, this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
should shoot someone for property damage/vandalism/theft, but every
responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits, and the punishment
must fit the crime. I mean, think about it--is a (really) harmless
prank worth killing over?

As I said, the situation described (punks setting off alarms and
taunting people to come out) could turn very ugly very quickly, and
it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line.

Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in

be on the safe side.

Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered
Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system
from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in
chip and the government has the key to every phone call. 
I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. 

What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or 
buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered
keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes 
to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the 
secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. 

That leads me to conjecture that:

1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys
that work for all the phones in the country. The part about
registering your keys is just bogus. 

or 

2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks
like this. Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to
town.

In either case, I think we need to look at this a bit deeper.""'jbl)mW:wxlD2

I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively
the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on
it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious
attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in
exactly the same manner..

  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)
  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)
  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles
  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)
  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles
  6. Two timing belts.
  7. Constant error signals from computer.

  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging
     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done
     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because
     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4
     weeks to get because it is on national back order. 

     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new
     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.

No way would I ever buy another Acura. It is highly overrated. .

Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.
However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all
five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against
muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do
not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and
open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know
that
historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone
by the death penalty.

My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the
law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no
precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for apostasy.

I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of ""fasad"". This
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.

I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication
of the book. However, the charge of ""fasad"" can encompass a
number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that
the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
""crisis"". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are
levelled at people, not books.

The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the
issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,
presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people
crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. 
Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost
his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then
Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while
protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily
concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again
attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this
point that the fatwa on ""fasad"" was issued.

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The
crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being
played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.

P.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of ""shatim"" also
applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
of the ""fasad"" ruling.

I do not feel like the cameras were out of range.  Cameras watched the first

confrontation with tanks.  Cameras watched the fire.  When weren't cameras 
able to watch?  When would cameras be unable to watch people coming out with

Well, that is what BATF should have done.  Either, Koresh would have gone 
peaceably as he has done in the past, or perhaps it was already too close 
to the apocalypse in his own mind.  It is hard to predict the actions of 
a leader who would not release the children when most rational people would.

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota
didn't care about ""little"" details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.

myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or
recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine.  

if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6.

I think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I don't think it is the
function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time
in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in
porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of
invalid C++ assumptions.

I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but
the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in
which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are
getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the
owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all
other pieces of ctrltest work fine.

Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:

- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,
  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ
  between MSC and BC).

- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++
  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place
  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for
  references).

I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have
not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope
that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's
hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.

      If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them.

Hi Noel,

I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,
triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code
example of how to do it.

Another way to do the bartman may be

- TGA2POV
- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.

  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript
  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open
  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.

Example:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" }
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   texture {
      Glass
   }
   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ""ABP"" black on white in
Times-Roman 256 points.

Soderstrom plays with Philly, but he doesn't have a moulded mask.
He's got the helmet and cage variety, in white.  Or at least that's

Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:


 Source: ""Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6""

 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
 forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi 
 collaboration.

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that ""create static RAM appearance"" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot.

Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes?

What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.

Any help is truly appreciated.....

Subject: Reserve officers say demographics ignored in nominations to close naval, marine reserve centers

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers
 To: National Desk, Defense Writer
 Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States, 202-479-2258

   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.
   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),
suggested ""concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.""
   He asked the commission ""to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action.""
   ""Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed,"" wrote Hultman.  ""The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations.""
   Hultman reminded the commission, ""The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis"" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve.
   ROA also noted ""that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.""
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to
Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,
Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro, Calif., plus six others.

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is ""better"" 
than the circulating version.

It doesn't really hurt legit users.  Shareware is still much cheaper than 
the alternatives.

just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost
16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere
$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their
54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,
repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope
in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but
before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.

Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz
sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front
end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for
equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.

So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where I need storage for
later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to
fall...

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert
unbalanced 1/4"" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher
quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4"". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.
The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).


Otherwise the other possibilities would be:

1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some communications program.

2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)

3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,
etal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.



To the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
use a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...

Issued by Khomeini it shouldn't be relevant to anyone. But issued

Anyone sufficiently well versed in Islamic law and capable of reasoning,

I disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other

trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next

realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he
apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be
a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &
didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither
changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he
knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all
that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.

I believe the reason that he & I ""click"" instead of ""bash"" heads is because
I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining
the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God
than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. 
Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from
the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the
world society.  The ""kitchen of heaven"" was all we had to look forward to
during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists
today.  I, too, have rejected
an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much
hypocricy exists behind the walls of ""God's house"" beginning with the
images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &
raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where
I can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytime

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

    If you mean in a ""newer, more powerful"" Mac system then the answer
is no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and
no longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.

At the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson
offers the following ""paraphrase"" of John 3:16:

   ""God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,
   to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life.""

The ""to die in our place"" bothers me, since it inserts into the
verse a doctrine not found in the original. Moreover, I suspect that
the poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic
(or penal) substitution.  I maintain that the Scriptures in speaking
of the Atonement teach a doctrine of Substitution, but not one of
Forensic Substitution.

Those interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my
essays on Genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7

Your logic is falty.  If Christianity is a DRUG, and once we die we
die, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that
while you are alive you enjoy yourself.

I also question your overall motives for posting this article.  Why
would you waste your presious fews seconds on this earth posting your
opinon to a group that will generally reject it.

If you die, never having acepting Christ as your savior, I hope you
have a fantastic life that it is all you evver dreamed because it is

I don't know where Douglas Adams took it from, but I'm pretty sure he's

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the

bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.

Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really
specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted 
and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because 
of race, religion and national origin?

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and 
idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A 
short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda 
and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious 
for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their 
neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely 
within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to 
x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is 
the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary 
heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, 
even lunatic. 

And we still demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide 
and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian 
political pressure.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. 

Now what would you do? 

Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by 
        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when
the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
    "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume
no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with
lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to
build something HLV-sized anyway.

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of which
would have far better cost-effectiveness.

Will they?  You can't usually take away one of the team's best

The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they
are on the decline. (There are exceptions, of course. Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose.)

I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many
verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been
shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)
Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion
of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well
as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses
and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with
them.

   Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the proper 
   channels, you might consider ther following:

   1) Chelated Manganese   25-50mg/day.
   2) Chelated Chromium    400-600mcg/day.
   3) Increase protein through foods or supplements.
   4) Avoid supplements/foods high in Potassium, Calcium, Zinc.
   5) Avoid Vit C supplements in excess of 100mg.
   6) Avoid honey and foods high in simple sugars.
   7) Enjoy breads, cereals, grains...

   Discuss the above with your health practitioner for compatibility
   with your body chemistry and safety.

Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at
least 10 at-bats.

It is early in the season so there are some high numbers.  Barry Bonds
finished last season at 0.795.

I welcome comments and suggestions.

   Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.


I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative ""exotics"" since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of
the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though ""accepted"", may
not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick
buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is
significantly inflated by these ""quacks of a different color"".  In fact, I'd
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these ""quacks"" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-
destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.


***************************************************
Now to make a general comment on many recent posts:
***************************************************

Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or
doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say ""quack-quack"" and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach
you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?

Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real
scary.

But what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this
newsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more
net.diagnoses.  Hey, they're free.


Jon ""Quacks 'R Us"" Noring


(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories, such as the ""yeast theory"", should create your own moderated group.
You can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you
can keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess 
we ""invaded"" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have 
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from 
Spain.

So if you mean by the word ""invaded"" some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally
""invaded"" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(If some nation ""invades"" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of
view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).

No, it's someone who believes in ""peace-at-all-costs"".  In other words,
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

""Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,"" you ask?  Well, it depends
on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over
freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's ""bad"" to be a peace-nik.

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be ""bad"" and ""unconscionable"".  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank
hypocrisy!)  All to stop we ""warmongers"" who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)

Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent.  If you will, mailmen could
be called apostles in that sense.  However, with Jesus, they were
designated and were given power.  Remember that there were many
thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did.  That didn't make them
apostles, though.

So how much would it cost as a private venture, assuming you could talk the
U.S. government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida? 



    Software engineering? That's like military intelligence, isn't it?

gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but
before going further, I thought I would ask whether someone has already

	Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object,
beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii. They
named the object Karla.

	The program said the object wasn't a gaseous giant planet, and
should be composed by rocks and ices.

	Can someone confirm these information? Could this object be a
new planet or a Kuiper object?

	Thanks in advance.

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it 
without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible 
enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving
them to their fate.

The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices
above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for
the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land
in a poor situation.

I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine,
and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't
The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances 
beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land,
they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the ""greater 
Arab unity"" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews
(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just 
business.

The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for 
Jewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose, 
the sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for 
contesting them.

SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
    frequently.


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).

    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,
    says:

	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of
	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target
	in second stage.""

    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try
    to interpret.

    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.

    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of
	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z
	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.

    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").

    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver
	complexity"").

    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio
	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.

    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.

    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""
    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle
    guy.)

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll
    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
    array.


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite
    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72
    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.
    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers.

    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press
    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions
    are not being covered.


    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS

    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:

	W6FXN  - Los Angeles
	K6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California
	WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.
	W5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas
	W6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.
	W1AW Voice Bulletins

	W1AW		 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290	3.990

    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.

    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC.

    Frequencies in the 10-20m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40
    and 80m bands LSB. Use FM for the VHF frequencies.

Get your facts straight before you post something like this.  The Duo
Dock does not have a CPU of its own.  It is a docking station with 
ports connecting various components, including the portable PowerBook
with its own CPU.  I guess these rumored new Duo Docks have a built-in
CPU to perform functions of their own.  Interesting!  If they're not
compatible with the current Duo models, I think you'll be hearing a
lot more ""screwed by Apple"" complaints.  Imagine a company obsoleting
(ooh, a new verb!) a virtually brand new computer... sheesh...

What kind of post is this?  If you have something substantial to tell the world,

In addition to restricted mileage, many classic insurance carriers also require
that the vehicle be garaged when not in use.

Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says.   


Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of
years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,
once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes
David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes
Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent
takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up
comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.
Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS
agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
""I am."" 

While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known
Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is
different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.
What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of
Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different
perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's
testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  

Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  ""I am"".  He has
revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).
Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.

Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? 
Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer
programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near
complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that
that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious
display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than
King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?

     Are we talking about ColorView for DOS here?  
     I have version 2.0 and it writes the temp files to its own
     current directory.
     What later versions do, I admit that I don't know.
     Assuming your ""expert"" referenced above is talking about

     Is the ColorView for unix what is being discussed?

the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a
liberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight
evangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources
try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while
blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.

This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of
related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter
went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the
technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)

>How can we help to make best use of computer technology ?

When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class
about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights
that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your
faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example
friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the
wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God
willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to
decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology
is against God's revealed word.

 David

Mr. water-head,

israel went into southern lebanon to  make sure that no

And I'm sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children of

I edited a few newsgroup from that line (don't like to crosspost THAT
much).  I can't compare the two, but I recently got an HP DeskJet 500.

I'm very pleased with the output (remember that I'm used to imagens,
laser and postscript printers at school -- looks very good.  You have
to be careful to let it dry before touching it, as it will smudge.

The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares.

The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not
had any problems with it.

Hope that helps some.

i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as
i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the
bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of
satan as a (excuse the pun) ""devil's advocate"" for yahweh.  see the
book of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_
references to ""lucifer"" in the bible except for a mistranslation of
""the morning star"" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which
probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as ""the
sun king"" referred to louis xiv.  

all in all, i don't know where the story _came from_; it may have been
rolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have
invented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am
in a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. 
They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package
until one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.
It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,
but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call
yet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.
Should I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until
they call me back?

I know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company. I would like to know how they got their money back.
If you have similar experience, please advise me.

Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent
for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums.  100 yrs ago
it was done all the time.  It has been done sporadically all along
in patients who won't take their medicine.  If you have TB you
may find yourself under surveilence of the Public Health Department
and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your

No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are
drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like
486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K
of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real
estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its
486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become
available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other
companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out
with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).

Avery was the #2 overall pick by the Braves, behind Mark Lewis (I think) in

A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?

B.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:

1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. The cause it not understood.
3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.

Right. So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase cars;

   Yeah, the ""Feingold Diet"" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
   children's development.  So much for the value of ""interesting anecdotal
   results"".  People will believe anything if they want to.

Thanks for all the interest in this problem of mine. I don't think it
is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown
any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.
She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.

The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our
immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running
nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. 

Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body
chemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures
either.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of
relief.  Thanks again.

This is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree to

to the right is unnecessarily confusing, when they'll do it anyway if they
just get on the bike and ride the damn thing.

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.

If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. 

In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing
exactly as *you* suggest!!

Subject: Quadra 700 Memory Install FAQ
Organization: University of Washington
Lines: 69
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu
Summary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation
Keywords: memory,quadra,700,install

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

Okay, I've received a whole lot of requests for the movie, so for

If Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my
business to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.  I think the
situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business.
I've had mine on order since January.  Apple finally called me last
week -- to tell me that I should have it ""by the second week of May.""
In the meantime, I've been stuck with my Duo210 without the
connectability I needed it for.  I'm sure there are plenty of people
who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is
right or at least justified, but I'm just a crabby consumer and
when I order a ""Duo210 with modem"" that's the product I expect.

Oh, well.  It's not like it's limited to the computer biz.  Remember
when the Miata came out?  What about those Cabbage Patch Dolls?  Well,
I want my toy!  ;)

This, simply stated, is a result of the bankrupt ethics in
the healthcare and scientific medicine industries.

America is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costing
us 15% of our GNP to support these industries, while delivering 
marginal health care to the community.

Unfortunately, the ""Clinton Plan"", in whatever form it

start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come
back.

My computer is a little 386/25 with copro, 4 Mega rams, Tseng 4000 (1M) running
MS-DOS 5.0 with HIMEM.SYS and no EMM386.SYS. I had the GO32.EXE too... but no
driver who run with it.

Do somenone know the solution to run XV ??? any help would be apprecied..

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path.

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio.

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance.

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.

Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before
break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer!

Lots of luck!

I think this is a big leap sex->depression.  One example is myself,
where no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,
depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say 
depression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come
from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and
promiscuity is used as an escape.
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
what is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just 
my opinion.

But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar and
countless others is still with us, although their works have perished.

But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,
their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if they
are utterly forgotten.

One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, which
I do not)

But in that time we can make a difference.

In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all the
point you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobody
to ask, ""Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna make
much of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?"".

But they will have already have made a difference, great or small,
before the end.

Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?

I don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. And
it does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.

>To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.

I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely my
definitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:

""Reality""	That which is real.
""Illusion""	That which is not real, but seems to be.
""Real""		Objectively Existing

For ""reality"" to be an ""illusion"" would mean, then:

That which is real is not real, but seems to be.

Or:

That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, but
does seem to objectively exist.

From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get a
contradiction, that no things objectively exist.

But I have a problem with this because I would like to say
that *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sum
and all that.

Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:
""Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.""

Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.

>  That the
>true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.

Have on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusion
too? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusion
as well?

If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.

>  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn

That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.

Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,
please show that this is true. If not, please explain how this
can give a purpose to anything.

> That gives a purpose to my little purposes,

How does it do that?

Wouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation for
some *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.

> and takes some of the pressure off.

What pressure?

>  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms
>if you're really just here to learn.

It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless your
goals either include doing so or require doing so before they
themselves can be achived.

Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves that
do not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Check
out yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is not
at all the same thing.

I'll have a crack at that.

(1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It is
the concept of life without death, life without end.

(2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.

(2a) No metaphor is adequate next to eternity; if it were we could not

Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''
That's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to
Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip,
then Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.''
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are

You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than
in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using.

Try the following:
   1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The
       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine
       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.

   2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)
       can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can
       buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run
       \windows\msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine.

So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,
Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.
Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good
teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.

YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.
Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a
coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto
game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a
great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.

But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel
doesn't have a game like that in him.

Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,
Dom has played well too.

FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,
Kasper...

Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.

Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to
go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those
sackcloth and ashes?

[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are
not surprised, though.]

>No, it is nothing like perpetual motion.  

Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was ""sounds almost like
perpetual motion"", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,
technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible
and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
approach? 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,
or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of
material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a
non-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?

To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of 
arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine
myself to answering the charge of illogic.
 
In a previous article, Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com (Geno) says:

>>If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,
>>then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means.
>
>Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
>it comes to their religion. 

This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,
taught to think. It is the fundamental premis ""A is not not-A"". If a thing
is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic 
asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We
should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word ""believe"",
however. The weak sense means I am not sure. ""I believe Tom went to 
the library."" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense
means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. ""I believe 
that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws."" (despite 
the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian
belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs
of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological 
topics.)
 
>Some take it to the extreme and say that
>their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings
>then you won't be ""saved"". 

Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the 
majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that
if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be
false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. 
(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)
 
>It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
>to know what God thinks/wants. 

It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless 
they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks
and wants.

>Especially when it's based upon your
>interpretation of a book. 

Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living
tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly
by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.

>The logic in the above statement is faulty
>in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be
>correct. 

If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet
tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we 
may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive
that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.
 
>It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.
>No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that

Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being 
can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find 
absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who
does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.

>As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half
>empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are
>contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be
>true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.

Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the
knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass 
is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half
full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole
point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist
and the optimist express the *same* fact.)
 
It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the 
same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail
to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief
and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great
scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has
been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal
agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs
are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict
some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations
of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have
been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,
**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical
to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, 
but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long
as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other 
as in error.

It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg
subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't
seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound
digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce
varous bit-rates. There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice
quality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.

Their DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't
need to play ""two-way-radio"". You can also download code to the DSP
subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in 
question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own 
vocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13"" monitor. What's
the deal on them?

1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max
and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?

2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?

3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What
bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some
applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?
How much slower is it?

4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was
incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,
or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
Microsloth) apps, for example)?

5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Thanks a lot for you input.

MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is
pure, the source should not be a problem. Your comment suggests that 
impurities may be the cause.
My experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.

Not Quite the point to be considdered here!
Fact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time

Hardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens.

No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is 
to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform.

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple! (50 million copies @ $100 is SERIOUS money!).

There is no contradiction here. It is essential in the sense that your

And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things

Neither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to
recognize the statement that these ""private funds"" were all tax exmpt.  In
otherwords, American taxpayers put up at least 30% of the money.  And
finalyy, how does ""Federal land"" mitigate the offensiveness of this alien

to a foreign entity?

That ""Federal land"" and tax money could have been used to commerate
Americans or better yet, to house homeless Americans.

	Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?
The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person
cannot.

	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,
but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)
I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your 
radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is
not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and
taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.
That is God.

	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,
how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or
a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force
ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us
enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think
we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us 
enough to help us through this world?

	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When
I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, 
because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see
the results in the long term, I find that He has led me
in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right
at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are
important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,
excercises of faith make the faith strong.  

	As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You must
choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to
follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with
you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,
we have to accept your decision, although we always keep
the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out
why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try
praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians
about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to
understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the
logic of this world.

	May the Lord bring peace to you,

Subject: WI and IL firearms law Questions
Organization: University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
Lines: 39
NNTP-Posting-Host: 129.89.9.13



A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  

Question #1

According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is
'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for
obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'

*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm
on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.



Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it
have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What
if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,
is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
period? 

Question #2

As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if
you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting?
Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  
One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
rich or famous or related to the mayor?

Please send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g
a little faster than I can handle.  Thanks again

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part
about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit
strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:

was unnecessary.

Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
state of Israel.

Anyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.

I don't think such a Canada is any more ""culturally similar"" to
the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual
rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely
related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ
greatly from those of the United States.

Actually, they do not have ""roughly the same... urban economy"", 
and extremely different ethnic composition.

However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,
the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are
predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class.
The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,
while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three
times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.
The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not
one of gun control.

>21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred...

That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing
the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their 
attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that
0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every
case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.
(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,
based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000
crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other 
studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.
Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences
involve killing the attacker.) 

So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) 
cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted
in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in
comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides
make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study
considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides
prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be
close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Oh well, obviously, no one really cares.

Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?

     Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,
at the Civic Arena.

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best 
strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.
Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,
when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; 
what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

Others can add on their opinions as well.

Try setting up another HPIII printer but when choosing what port to connect it
to choose FILE instead of like :LPT1.  This will prompt you for a file name
everytime you print with that ""HPIII on FILE"" printer. Good Luck.

Hi, You might want to read Charismatic Chaos by John MacArthur.  In it
he discussed exactly this queation, amongst others.  In my own words,
VERY simplified, his position is basically that one must decide, what
is the most important - experience or Scripture?  People tend to say
Scripture, without living according to that.  Their own
feeling/prophecy/etc tends to be put across without testing in the
light of Scripture.

There's a lot more than this, really worthwhile to read whether you're
Charismatic or not.

 There was an article on clari.news.religion in the last few days about a
Polish tribunal decision. It said that crucifixes and religious classes in
public schools were okay; and that children who did not want to take religion
class could not be forced to take an ethics class as a substitute.

Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!

Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,
if that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.

Indeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will
do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some
""facilitations""? Of course, you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters, because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
-quickly-, right? Like, they could have a copy of the database, and
worry about a warrant later...

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and
not an entirely different source.

We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke
that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.

When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on

Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be

That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
 
The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.

In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.
 
But how is that connected to a redating of John?

It likely has nothing to do with ""chunks of plaque"" but it sounds like

Subject: Drug Use Up At Younger Age
Organization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, Stillwater
Keywords: youths drugs LSD inhalants
Lines: 62


The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,
1993 issue of USA Today (""Drug Use Up At Younger Age"" by Mike
Snider, p. 1A).

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -
    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners, says a new survey.

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    ""statistically significant increases"" in eighth-graders' use of
    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.

    ""We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing
    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence,"" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services.

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long
    decline.

    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the 30 days before they were polled:

        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;
                         cocaine 1.3%.

    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.

    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%
    over 1991. 

    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%
    tried it in the last year.

    Reducing drug use among students ""requires a different kind of
    strategy"" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan.

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders
    disapprove of them.

    ""It's scary,"" Shalala says.  ""Dealers are focusing on younger, more
    vulnerable kids.""

people would have come out alive. It was obvious to anyone with the remotest
contact with reality that such an outcome was likely (not just possible)
however the fire started. As, Mr Lawnmower, you seem to have already entered

No. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat,
config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File
menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other
program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.

I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was
just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The
reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals
about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry
under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for
internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice
multi-file replacement for Notepad.

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the

trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers (2^30, about one billion), multiplied by the number
of different S1, S2 combinations.

Yes, Ivan Rodriguez, last year.  Batted .260 and threw out 51% of the
baserunners.  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA.  20 years old last

Subject: IDE/ESDI coexistence
Summary: How to make IDE and ESDI controllers live together???
Keywords: HD, controller, IDE, ESDI, disks
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 57

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
	Many thanks,
			Cat.

You have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument.
 
And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It
rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system
without checking if they suit the description.

to Islamic law?

As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex
nor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important
point, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even
stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The
consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids.
Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex
is not controlled is completely counterfactual.
 
 
And since you have brought up the point, is your god evil or not?

As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he
should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience
forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate
this system of government-sanctioned slavery.

If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY)
and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia),
we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by
improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending,
but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the 
infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)

A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing
decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper
than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the 
most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in
my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates
or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the
money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too
shallow to use!

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).

Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows!

 Also, to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)

A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,
none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6
pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you,
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!

When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better.

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.
Image some red necks yelling at you ""We are going to FUCK YOU!""
and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight
on you!)

If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!

I think if there is to be a prize and such.. There should be ""classes""
such as the following:

Large Corp.
Small Corp/Company (based on reported earnings?)
Large Government (GNP and such)
Small Governemtn (or political clout or GNP?)
Large Organization (Planetary Society? and such?)
Small Organization (Alot of small orgs..)

The organization things would probably have to be non-profit or liek ??

Of course this means the prize might go up. Larger get more or ??
Basically make the prize (total purse) $6 billion, divided amngst the class
winners..
More fair?

There would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events,
umpire and such and watch for safety violations (or maybe not, if peopel want
to risk thier own lives let them do it?).

Any other ideas??

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson
are playing for Canada.

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,
and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not

in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the

Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.
The rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an

Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.

No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is
that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of
Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and
secondary neuronal ischemia).

Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not
seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The
Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF
studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,
but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.

From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in
the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From
another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of
the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,
therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.

Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling
headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic
colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients
they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill
my office with patients holding their heads in pain.

I agree.  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me

You're right, and I retract the suggestion.  Still, I wonder.  That
there are only 60 bits of key information should, in principle, be
detectable.  Maybe some variant of the tests Rivest et al. did to
demonstrate that DES was probably not a group?  It should make an
interesting paper -- a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem.

DFW was designed with the STS in mind (which really mean very little).  Much of
their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
others pulled up to gates.  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
airport was.

For Dallas types:  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the
shuttle WAS landing at DFW. (For the rest, they are currently having some power
struggles between the airport and surrounding cities).

Which means he has absolutely no idea about what the Assumption is.

However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no
way God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our
Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the
redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not
ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along
with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in
Heaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to
any of the previously mentioned personages.

Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.

I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these
people, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I
see no reason for embarrassment.  If you think that errors and flawed
arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss
nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course
will introduce you to their weaknesses.

I said nothing about ""the masses.""  However comparing ""the masses"" in
our day and in Aquinas' day really *is* odd.  Read Ortega y Gasset on
this.

I'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and
winning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be
unaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone
pragmatics).  (I am assuming that both parties are college graduates
or better...)  Myself, I don't bother any more.

Subject: Q: Colormaps with dialog shells
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 17


I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the ""Technicolor
Effect"" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.

My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the
default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
window of my application, I get my colormap.

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

On my LC (RZ to any ex-colonists) I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel

and pour out a cup of hot water.
I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter.

CNN just claimed he bought 104 ""semi-automatic assault rifles"".  And
they say Koresh wasn't god-like...  He managed to buy or build a
collection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles...  Quite a feat,
I would say.  ;-)

They're still making charges of ""sexual abuse"" and such, or course.
Nobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing

I also heard that they're claiming to be cautious because of Koresh's
""heated ammunition stockpile"".  I seem to recall that smokeless powder
tends to decompose at even moderate temperatures.  I would be rather
surprised, after a fire of that nature, if *any* of his ""stockpile"" is
unexploded, or unburned.

I think *anything* is legal if you have the proper license.  If he had

handgrenades to go with his launcher.

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point.
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land,
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because,
for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.
The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of
it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them.
They are to blame, not the Jews.

Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear
arms shall not be infringed, so a well regulated militia may be more easily
formed.  I have an interpretation of the Second that shows there are no

With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration
is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue
of the Copt-Net Newsletter :

Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed
to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played
leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak
about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the
Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said
that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their
time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics
started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor
Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.
Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference
was clear: ""You have nothing to do with the Church.""  These political motives
became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was
unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in
monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only
one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.

The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was
portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant
believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His
divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His
humanity were united in one nature called ""the nature of the incarnate word"",
which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two
natures ""human"" and   ""divine""  that are   united in   one ""without mingling,
without confusion, and without alteration"" (from the  declaration of faith at
the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures ""did not separate
for a moment or the twinkling of an eye"" (also from  the declaration of faith
at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).

The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of
Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they
wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,
independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very
strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the
Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal
to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the
extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic
Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile ""semantic"" differences between
all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th
successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  ""To the  Coptic Church, faith is
more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and
terminology are of  little importance to us.""  Throughout this  century,  the
Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The
Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has
remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a
member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East
Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the
Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the
theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and
Evangelical Churches.

[...]

As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign
a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism
was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in
Monophysitism.

Peace,

Nabil

[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me
is confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As
Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were
actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil
explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered
heretical probably aren't.

Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and
Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree
that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course
of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got
rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are
groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This
posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also
a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called
monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called
Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his
heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the Antiochene tradition.

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might have
to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the
street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,
or even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick them
up earlier now, though.

In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed
 for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think
 it laps the pentium.

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of
Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that 
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or 
innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than 
objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be 
sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a 
small price to pay for the common good don't you think?

Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:

Motherboard
Battery
Power Supply

I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.

These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized
a couple of old machines.

If you are interested, please e-mail me.

Note: For those who want to convince themselves that they are somehow
superior because they have newer and better machines, or who want to
inform me that these are ""worthless junk,"" save your effort.  I'll
just delete the note.  Those of us who bought these machines when they first
came out still find them useful for word processing, etc..  I'm saving
mine as a future antique.

No, you don't understand.  I said that I don't think people can discuss
the subjective merits of religion objectively.  This should be obvious.
People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion,

But, guns and axes are tools, both of which have been used for murder.
Should both be taken away?  That is to say, I don't think motto misuse

  Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is
probably the weakest evidence.

  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out
by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of
detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used
today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the
existance of Jesus, only of his activities.

  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the
gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a
source).

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.

Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf
item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include
attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you
don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like).

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the

suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing

I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various
players that were coming into the NHL. I got this particular card of
a Russian named Viktor Kozlov. It says ""many scouts believe he will
be the #1 pick in 1993"". Another guy is quoted as saying ""He's as 
good as Mario Lemieux"". Anyone know who this guy is?????

Hi!

I remember reading (or hallucinating) that NCD's PC-Xremote functionality had 
been given, by NCD, to MIT for inclusion in X11R6.  Is this true?  If so,
(set mode/cheap) can I just wait for X11R6 to get compressed serial line

: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications

: probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court.
Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record
calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants
and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this
strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not
in the near term.)

In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence
inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to
interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised
that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything
but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.

Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically
feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without
warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,
start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,
decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation
gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.

While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this
archiving scenario to extremes, read ""Lacey and his Friends"", a
collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the
slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's
stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can
get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major
streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and
teller machines, don't we?

And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public
places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever
to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy
cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and
after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't
curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd
be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a
VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.

And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.

After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...

Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became
pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all
crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds
of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their
execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of
competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  
I can't imagine why.

Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left 
out the part about ""we all ate the same thing.""  Changes things a bit, eh?

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

Pepper makes me sneeze.  If it doesn't affect you the same way, fine.

anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I
apologize for pointing out the obvious.  It was a waste of the
Net's time.  I hope, though, that most American citizens have
the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to
understand the relationship between the Justice Department
as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which

Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his

Subject: Version control for MAC and PC LAN
Organization: Prodigy Services Co.

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      
filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   
a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  
to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC 
product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).

Could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid.

In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a
project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in
hassles.

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to
the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically
down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any
new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --
the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,
you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns
and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.

The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for
more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.
For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop
a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper
might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less
ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing
sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
money in a big way.

Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a
minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which
dominates the cost of the project.

    I am sorry you find these charges amusing, Mark. I understand your
frustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions
challenged. Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer
includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their Tzotzil-Spanish
dictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are
threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation,
repression, revolution, and described words which can express
ideological concepts in examples like ""Boss--the boss is good. He treats
us well and pays us a good wage."" As some of my students would say,
""NOT!""  
     Your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe me--indeed, why
should you? If you are interested enough to do some further research
though, and you sound as if you are, here are some references for you.

Hi,

I'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  My machine has 4 serial ports.  Com 1 and3
and 2 &4 share same IRQs.  You mean I can't plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work?

If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And,
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too?

Probably, law enforcement people (Park Service Police and D.C. cops),
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA

Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain
chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,
(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized
example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location
and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying
external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances
caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will
be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred
years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few
tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the
investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some
hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding
the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.

Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein
reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as
when Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural
cause to explain things we don't yet understand.

       The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase.
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally.

       (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of
Europe's that makes it ""visible?"")

       This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress
enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that.
(Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd 
have a difficult time ""forcing"" anything like that.)

       Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to ""freeze""
tax rates.

       However, this is something that bothers me.  We're always talking
about ""consumer confidence"" and ""consumer spending"" as gauges for the
economy.  If they really are important, wouldn't shifting taxes to
consumption provide a disincentive to spend money?

All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year 
moon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.

If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally 
reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as 
Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh 
ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.

But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

Could it work with the moon? Who are the far-sighted financial backers of 
today?

:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I
didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 

Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day
vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease 
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
meat).

Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness. 

Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards.

Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).

Michael Bushnell writes;

>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western
>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that
>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but
>it is not ""in use.""

Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use
of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it
said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that
has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the
Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.
	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the
Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.
	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in
ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East
emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father
through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the
Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see
below)

	""Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do
call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the
root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the
river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,
but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must
necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on
that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there
are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is
third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit
of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,
and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.""
	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)

and

	""I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father
through the Son""
	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)

And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,
Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of
generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession
emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in
a more preeminent way.

	""For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it
from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the
Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called
unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of
theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a
matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy
Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives
to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit
proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of
the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound
mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,
however, but proceeds from each and both.""
	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)

So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at
least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but
in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the
procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the
Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,
the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any
mention of the Son being necessary.
	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope
St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.
Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose
of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the
Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic
position, which I enunciated above.
	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I
will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke
of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone ""to produce,
write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by
the Fathers of Nicea.""  That Creed is a different Creed than that of
Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of
course in that they were condemning the adoption of the
Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of
Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,
who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the
Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy
Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan
Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council
Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy
Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been
against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves
approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations
of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work
done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows
that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed
by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians
in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until
many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was
not disputed, I provide more quotes below.

	""Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to
God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly
clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding
from it.""
	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial
Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)

	""The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he
is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone
loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it
is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he
is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the
Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,
that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall
receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'""
	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)

	""The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the
appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to
the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the
Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will
receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the
Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit
divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of
the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like
soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father
and of the Son, a third by appelation....
	""The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit
breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor
is the Spirit created.""
	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,
8 and 75 (374 AD)

	""Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is
it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,
it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to
speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the
Son, His Sources.""
	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)

	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,
Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,
all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine
expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church
that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus
who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is
not enough to bring up the ""proceeds from the Father"" line of the Creed
or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does
not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does
proceed from the Father.

  Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for ""cheap"",
but I cannot get the source for ""cheap"", hence I am limited to using whatever X
libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not
seen it myself).

  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5
libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the
vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same
problem when X11R6 becomes available.

  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do
not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of ""free"", doesn't it?

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal
clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up
SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.
Check it out.

Sorry!! :-)

Call the four points A, B, C and D. Any three of them must be
non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface
of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either
they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).

A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC
and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.
This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.

Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points
on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in
fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane
containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any
plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles
to the ABC one.

Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference
of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the
normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular
bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is
not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).


Algorithm:

Is the sphere well defined?
    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).
    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).
    (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure).
Yes. Find its centre.
    (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.
    (2) Find their point of intersection (P).
    (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N).
    (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on the
	ABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A).
    (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L)
    (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q).
Q is the centre of the desired sphere

Numerically:

If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radius
of the ABC circle) and subject to error. It's best to choose D so
that the least of AD, BD and CD is larger than for any other choice.

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in
a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

Occam's Razor is not a law of nature, it is way of analyzing an
argument, even so, it interesting how often it's cited here and to
what end. 
It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being
primitive, simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and
childish, and yet again condemned as being too complex (Occam's
razor), the scientific explanation of things being much more
straightforeward and, apparently, simpler. Which is it to be - which
is the ""non-essential"", and how do you know?
Considering that even scientists don't fully comprehend science due to
its complexity and diversity. Maybe William of Occam has performed a
lobotomy, kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away ...

This is all very confusing, I'm sure one of you will straighten me out
tough.

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years.

The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. 

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United 
States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative 
Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

Hello,

	I understand this philosophy.  The bears are a national
treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it
do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be
killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy
visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans
are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.
I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.

	The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national
treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to ""allow""
provision for defense against them would also ""allow"" provision
for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided
that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than
to take a chance on threatening the bears.

	Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be
""managed"" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think
of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)

Well, a student body president can't exactly campaign on the stand

Sci.E(E) netters:

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.

P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy?

This is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is
indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor
unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made
mostly of carbon and water is ""fair"".

However, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about
the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily
includes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation);
not at all the same thing.

Granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral
sentiment as near as I can tell.

If *your* idea of God ""condemns"" heathens to ordinary death, I have no
problem with that. I do have a problem with the gods that hide from humans
and torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing right.

Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too.

If I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.

It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,
plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly
one year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spare
any further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody
5'7"" +/- 5"" will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not a
small bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power,
great brakes, good Karma.

Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of
scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective
morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.

Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the

Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,

If anyone's interested, Logos number is (800) 837-7777.  I ordered mine
last Wednesday and got my modem on Friday, though it's not to far from
Cleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.

What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor

for that xterm.

From the man page.....

-cr color
 This option specifies the color to use for text cur-
 sor.   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <---
 color that is used for text.  <---

However this doesnt seem to be the case, it appears to default to black
or to whatever XTerm*cursorColor is set to.

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with
""Kartagener's syndrome"", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic
infections. ""Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in
absence of this, laterality can be ""random."" People with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their
rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong
side). 

According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current
information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking
about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of
which there is probably one at NCSU.

Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
resultant steam drives the turbines.

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

Not only that, but if I'm not mistaken Detroit scored 4 goals on their first
five shots on net...looks like Toronto's cream cheese run continues (or is

 Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially
lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the
muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or
plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the
intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also
seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].
 Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to 
be a proper reaction [and so does the law].  
 Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force
has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the
less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some
risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent 
since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
more deadly.

It sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to ""."" in
Contol Panel (under International).  This makes 23,482 look like 23.482
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping
off everything to the right of the first period.

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever

initiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already
we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us.
Bullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli.  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay

(please respond via email!)

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail 
for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.

Any hints?

Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

I've sent the article.  In terms of the group discussion, I wanted to point

""abstinence education"".

We had ""non-liberal education"" regarding drugs when I was a kid in the 60's,

drugs has proven effective, I think.

Maybe I'm a little tired but I can't seem to follow the logic here. If 
whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest
(RC only apparently) is required. 

In fact if I read the next verse correctly (Matthew 18:19) I understand that
for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching
one thing and it shall be done.

[Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any completely precise
statements about what is needed.  (As usual, the current edition of
the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the
priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be
required.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid
any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The
community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are
involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of
their commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public
commitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular
marriage.  Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in
exceptional cases (""valid but irregular"").  Ne Temere (1907) says that
no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according
to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new
canon law retains this, but I'd rather see a more recent and
authoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required
for Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between
baptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh]

I do read Av Week and don't remember this.  Could you supply the date

but has more capability ( read : can land at smaller airfields of which
there are more of ) than the C-5.  Now is the C-17 pork?  It depends
on whether your job relies on it or not.  :)  In California right now,
I would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many

Hi,

Right now I should do some characterization of opamps. Because I don't  
have
special equipment for this task, I have to do this job with relativly  
simple
equipments (Frequency sweeper, DSO, etc.). 
Does anyone know good test circuitry for characterization of opamps? 
Especially for measuring open-loop gain, phase margin, PSSR, CMMR and so  
on.
Are there any books or application notes on this subject available?

Please reply vi e-mail or nn.

Thanks
Mark

Subject: Need help with video detection circuit
Organization: Systems'n'Software
Lines: 55



I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

Article-I.D.: max.1993Apr6.125512.1
Distribution: world
Lines: 78
NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu

The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly
had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and
commercial space.  This is how it went...



After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,
I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty
Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard
the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.
Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.

We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,
who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not
bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to 
make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.

Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking
to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.
We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  
Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that
we brought up.

But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate
aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.
So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming 
feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.
We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism
paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog
over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is 
more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to 
understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education 
whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other
fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday 
would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.

We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal
communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided
in those sectors.

Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..
We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.

We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.

We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),
and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.

In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data 
Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.
He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,
and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually
happen immediatly there.

The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know
the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers.

Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He
said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this
would be something that she would be very interested in, although they
do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the
state 1 week out of 6 these days.

All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.

Excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he
doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings. He
also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous. I don't hear any of these

so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are

so well? Hmm?

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the
death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent,
and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise
I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.
The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public
or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not
punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this
trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but
historically they are the exception.

Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of ""Shatim"".

Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it
at a game in Boston.  

It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The ""Golden Triangle""
(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along
with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the 
other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens
logo, and a space for the ""new"" (now current) logo.

Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it
for him.  

But while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The
very next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask
done in by a goalie's superstition.

Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who
retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?
After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.
Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in
reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,
unless you're a franchise player.

	Jesus was born a Jew.  We have biblical accounts of
both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back
to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus
was Semitic.
	As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him
neither ""white"" nor ""black,"" and in some sense underscores the
point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his
message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate
on.
	Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African
involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of
the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter
9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,
treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely
African.  Because ""Ethiopia"" at that time indicated a region
just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not
only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian
as well.

Nick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than

expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian
mountains.  Said subjects basically said, ""Stop us if you can.""  He
couldn't.

That's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian
Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have
quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of
going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right
now.

Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to
carry out as ""scientific research"" which just coincidentally requires
the recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.

Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in
the late '70's for his commercial space launch project (one of the very
earliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise
missiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.

I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which
I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one 
of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's
_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles 
Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT 
translation in the New American Bible.  He noted ""...certain practices have 
been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, 
and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.""  I note that at my 
parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the 
offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word ""risen"".  This was not a 
kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.

I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a
whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation
on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).
Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is
the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems
so...Christian?

The manta was a two-door sedan in the US.
It had a 1900 engine.
Was sometimes referred to as an Opel 1900.
Manta's are also ve hot and fun cars too.

	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she
doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It
is made of 3/4"" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
professionals can open it rather easily:

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2"" to 7/8"" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8"" model).

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

Subject: The Escrow Database.
Organization: Partnership for an America Free Drug
Lines: 77

Here is a disturbing thought.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)

Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.

Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.

Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat.) 

Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.

Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases.

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
Clipper chips.

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.

Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all.

In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine. 

However, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, 
CMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be. 

When unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:

Clock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.

Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more
difficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in
any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support
this?

I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan
had been writing it.

Newsflash:
Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red
Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of
the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.
The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.
Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been
denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers
were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the
Red Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered
heavy casualties while doing so.

As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes

The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick
it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just
have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch
to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 "" apart.)

This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)

If you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the
other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to 
undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for 
another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone
else could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use
would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems

First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing
people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on
whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed
punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus
to ""seek and save that which was lost"" (Luke 19:10)?

You asked for it.

2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.
Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in
God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.
2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples ""will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence of the Lord"".
2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth
being condemned.
Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in
the ""fiery lake of burning sulfur"".
Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast
""will be tormented with burning sulfur"" and there being ""no rest day or
night"" for them because of it.
Psalm 9:17:  ""The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that
forget God.""

I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.

>Darius

[In the following I'm mostly playing ""devil's advocate"".  I'm not
advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that
it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible
to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often
uses the term ""second death"".  The most obvious understanding of that
would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks
both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms
that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince
you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that
there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to
understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,
whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35
implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably
they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to 
understand this passage in a non-literal way.)

2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them
in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.

Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is
eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.
Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the
eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet
will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being
thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as ""the second death"".
This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as
the devil, and humans?

2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is ""everlasting destruction""?
This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be
understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think
that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in
eternity.

2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.
Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above
Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,
it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says
that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that 
there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people
are tormented forever.

Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.

Well said, Michael!

The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual 
Works of Mercy:

admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy 
                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)

These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People 
ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or 
prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more 
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.

--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models
  is the ""300"", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the
  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0
  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared
  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new
  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look
  completely different.

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).

As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.

The answer is 161.33 feet.

 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team.
   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.

I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  That is because your
premises are wrong from the word ""Go"".  You claim that Christianity is
based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the
current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence
that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.

Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs ""regardless of
any evidence that you may find to the contrary.""  Without any evidence
to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem 
argument.

Mind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion.
It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do 
base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to 
the contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.

Playoffs:

*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme
by Rick Sadowski, Daily News

Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
fun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I
think I have worked hard enough for that.""

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
6-3 opening victory.

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick
Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.

Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.

Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn.

""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I
dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd be
happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.""

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,
according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday.

""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""

""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've
got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect
more from him than he does.""

Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.

""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,
a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""

""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry

Hello Hockey fans.
Bonjour tout le monde!

Well, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not
to televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!
Anyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can
not find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing
everything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.

I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now
that ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to
pull in
three games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am
not sure.

IF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to
telent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.

Thanks in advance
Merci d'avance

P.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.

Sure.  Why keep using oil?  A hydrogen/electric economy would likely be
cleaner and more efficient in the long run.  The laws of supply and demand

My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.

  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.
  (Ps. 32:1).

and quoted by the apostle Paul:

  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
  imputeth righteousness without works,
  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
  are covered.
  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)

The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are
parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational
distinction is unwarranted.

I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is
going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for
millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver
was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting
speculation, though.

I'll leave comments on the so-called ""bema seat"" vs. ""throne"" judgments to
someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala
dispensationalism.

I would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to
'blocking' prayer.  I have trouble thinking that God would allow
anything to block our access to him in prayer, especially if we have
sinned and are praying for forgivenenss.
    I can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our
sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has
happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are
'hindered' by our own actions.
    But I don't think anything can 'block' the transmission, or
reception of prayer to God.
Shalom,                                      Len Howard

Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.

Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!

Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back

How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can
maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.

In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-
way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.
He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and
Quinn in my estimation.

I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen
in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.

Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They
certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.
The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914
and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has
considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up
a bit too slow.

The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it
in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded 
as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to
preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.

the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as
a check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into
the constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives
of the states is not a reasonable restriction.

I happen to take the violation of a person much more seriously than the
""violation"" of a mindless clump of cells smaller than my thumb.

Your mileage may vary.

The Ventura County DA came to the same conclusion in the report he

                       Constructing a Logical Argument

Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument
found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.

Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise
OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument.

Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely
explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job.

Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A
proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""It is
raining"" or ""Today is Tuesday"".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to
be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning
of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning.

The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it.  So ""God exists"" and ""There exists a
God"" both express the same proposition.

An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, ""a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition"".  An argument consists of
three stages.

First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. 

Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"",
""since"", ""obviously"" and so on.  (The phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with
suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to
question it.  You can always say ""Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious"" when
you've heard the explanation.)

Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of
valid inference.

The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or
""therefore"".

Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude""
and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.

For example:

Every event has a cause (premise)
The universe has a beginning (premise)
All beginnings involve an event (premise)
This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)
Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)

Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.

Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated 
afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if 
sometimes a little confusing.

Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some
statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:

""If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,
 or the Son of God.""

This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its 
conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll
come to those later.)

Another example:

""God created you; therefore do your duty to God.""

The phrase ""do your duty to God"" is not a proposition, since it is neither
true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an
argument.

Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form ""A because
B"".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the
statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then
it is not an argument, it is an explanation.

For example:

""There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not
 start."" -- This is an argument.

""My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.""
 -- This is an explanation.

There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must
also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is true.

An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;
however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments, and about how probable their premises are.

There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.

It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly 
counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more
carefully.

Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. 
For example:

   All insects have wings (premise)
   Woodlice are insects (premise)
   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)

Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. 
If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. 
The argument is thus entirely valid.

More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,
as in:

   All fish live in the sea (premise)
   Dolphins are fish (premise)
   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)

However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for
implication.

The symbol ""=>"" denotes implication; ""A"" is the premise, ""B"" the conclusion. 
""T"" and ""F"" represent true and false respectively.

Premise Conclusion Inference
   A        B        A=>B
----------------------------
   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference
   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.

   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion
                             false, the inference must be invalid.

   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,
                             the conclusion must be true.

A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound 
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments.

To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.

In everyday English the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair
enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing.

So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive.

ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)

The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It
is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"". 
The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.

For example:
""... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.""

ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM

Argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"".

The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.

For example:
""Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.""

Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by 
showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not
argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).

The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances.

For example:
""It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?""

This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument.

This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For 
example:

""Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. 
You're white.""

This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is
also known as ""poisoning the well"".

ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM

Argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"".  This fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true, a basic scientific principle.)

Examples:
""Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.""

""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has
shown any proof that they are real.""

Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.

Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can 
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:

""A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no
such flood occurred.""

In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,
however.

ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM

This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is 
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a 
conclusion accepted.  For example:

""I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me
guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.""

ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM

This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language.  For example:

""Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.""

""The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""

ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM

This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct.

ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM

The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion.  For example:

""Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.""

This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly
between:

""Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation""
and
""John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
 computer""

Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable 
whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.

THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT

The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific.  For example:

""Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must
dislike atheists.""

This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.

CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION

This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases.

For example:
""Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are
insincere.""

SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER

A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.

NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

These are known as False Cause fallacies.

The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For 
example:

""I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God
cured me of the headache.""

The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For 
example:

""The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons.""

CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that
because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.

PETITIO PRINCIPII

This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached.

CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO

This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:

""Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. 
Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open
to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office.""

Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the 
conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. 
Another example is the classic:

""We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the
Bible is true because it is the word of God.""

COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION

This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded 
question:

""Have you stopped beating your wife?""

The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,
when they ask questions like:

""Where did you hide the money you stole?""

Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:

""How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?""
or
""Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""

IGNORATIO ELENCHI

The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument 
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion.

For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length
that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.

Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light.

EQUIVOCATION

Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument.  For example:

""What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it
remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""

AMPHIBOLY

Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.

ACCENT

Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized.  For example, consider:

""We should not speak ILL of our friends""
and
""We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS""

FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION

One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole.  For example:

""The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very 
lightweight.""

The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:

""A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses.""

FALLACY OF DIVISION

The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like
its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:

""You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.""

The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item.  For example:

""Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT

This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful
events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event.

For example:
""If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana.""

""A IS BASED ON B"" FALLACIES / ""IS A TYPE OF"" FALLACIES

These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.

Examples:
""Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of
history?""

""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a
form of Christianity?""

""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?""

AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A
is true"".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for
implication given earlier.

DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B
is false"".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy.

Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has
the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"", where A does NOT in
fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is
invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce
anything about B.

CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL

This fallacy is an argument of the form ""If A then B, therefore if B then A"".

ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM

This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old, or because ""that's the way it's always been.""

ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM

This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else.

ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM

The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those
with more money are more likely to be right.

ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM

The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam.

ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM

This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard.  An ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something.

BIFURCATION

Also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist.

PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS

This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question.

NON SEQUITUR

A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it.

RED HERRING

This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made, towards a different conclusion.

REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION

Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF

The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.

STRAW MAN

The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made.

THE EXTENDED ANALOGY

The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two 
different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a 
claim that those situations are analogous to each other.

This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about 
anti-cryptography legislation:

""I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""

""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported
 Martin Luther King.""

""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
 struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!""

TU QUOQUE

This is the famous ""you too"" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:

""You're just being randomly abusive.""
""So?  You've been abusive too.""

This appeared today in the 

The Japan Economic Journal reported GM plans to build a Toyota-badged car
in the US for sale in Japan.  Bruce MacDonald, VP of GM Corporate
Communications, yesterday confirmed that GM President and CEO Jack Smith
had a meeting recently with Tatsuro Toyoda, President of Toyota.  
this meeting the two discussed business opportunities to increase GM
exports to Japan, including further component sales as well as completed
vehicle sales,
parts sales, the two presidents agreed conceptually to pursue an
arrangement whereby GM would build a Toyota-badged, right-hand drive
vehicle in the US for sale by Toyota in Japan.  A working group has been
formed to finalize model specifications, exact timing and other details.

Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is
only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this
for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes.  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff
""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living. 

Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The 
emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year.  They proved it.

cordially, as always,

rm

When you say, ""By definition"", what exactly is being defined;
certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the ""rules of
nature"" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but
actually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your
further thoughts on the question.

And you know why this is? Because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as
someone who can do no wrong, and you've _defined_ people who do wrong as
atheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,
as such, has no value.

I was wondering if anyone had any information about Molluscous contagiosem.
I acquired it, and fortunately got rid of it, but the question still lingers
in my mind: Where did it come from?  The little bit of info that I have 
received about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually, but
also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia.

Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally 
be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing 
Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks 
who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's 
informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For 
instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they 
watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can 
read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what 
really happened. 

There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee 
Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, 
the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, 
the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek 
Men's Lycee Foundation.  

As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' 
in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts 
have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, 
the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti 
Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks
in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been 
active until 1984. But they were first told to remove
the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down. This is also the 
final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.

In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish
parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment
with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was
of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official
was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three 
years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than 
a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority 
complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. 

The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' 
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference 
to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the 
existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the 
essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger 
Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the 
three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of 
themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized 
according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'

It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece 
and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.
The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish
minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with 
the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,
in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting
religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek 
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective
of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although
the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in
Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.

The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic 
convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an 
attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a 
violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' 
Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection 
of historical monuments. 

The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new 
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward 
Hellenizing the region.

And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human 
Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by 
the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation 
of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, 
Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of 
Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. 
His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in 
24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his 
involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice 
and remains without a job. 

Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating 
the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their 
findings were published in a report titled 

 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'

The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the 
Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, 
the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in 
Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against 
the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the 
Lausanne Convention. 

The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik
were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in
Karotas was razed by bulldozers.

Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going 
to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The 
discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not 
stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles 
I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks
in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.

It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration 
has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made 
plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it 
has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on 
conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek 
and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned 
to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the 
transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern 
Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of 
the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.

An acceptable method may certainly be found when there
is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent
behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning
of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were 
dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. 
Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.

Now wait, there is more.

  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by
  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,
  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).

  pages 82-83:

<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus
   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered
   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their
   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age
   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst
   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a
   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities
   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.

   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from
   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript
   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.

   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the
   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire
   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt
   end of a gun.

   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls
   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers
   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house
   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath
   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.

   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and
   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then
   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been
   no more heard of.

   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded
   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.

   The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:

  Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed
  Bohor Levy, tailor               killed
  Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed
  Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed

  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet
because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you
attack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's
question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some
INTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!
{assuming you are also semitic}
	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives.
	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism.

There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, 
however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
former) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. 
I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing 
""Islamicization"" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same
approach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat.

To Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
of those *outside* its own ""group"". If I am told that ""I am not one of
you"" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.
If I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic
world and *actively did not* accept my ""minority"" status, I *would also 
certainly* see Islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained, 
through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities
within their ranks.

How could this possibly be ""environmental vandalism"" when there is no
""environment"" to vandalize up there?

Since the advertising ""is just to help defray costs"", it's certainly no
surprise that ""the taxpayers would bear most of the expense"".  Sounds
like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the
expense if they didn't do the advertising.

Great idea, they should have done it long ago.

I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,
but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it's in LEO, so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if
it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky.

No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so
it would be no surprise.

Well, look on the, er, bright side.  Imagine the looks on the faces of

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.

    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid.

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.

Subject: Re: [long]: Gun Hearings Day in Massachusetts (April 7)
Organization: Stratus Computer, Inc.
Lines: 263
Distribution: usa
NNTP-Posting-Host: rocket.sw.stratus.com

[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]

Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day
with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.
It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,
whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from
wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.

Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to
remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been
checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the
people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of
""election fraud"" to hold their jobs.

Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and
sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and
telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too
many cases, who they were).

Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and
discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a
delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater
of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was
being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or
ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.

The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner
Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's
hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive
husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole
our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an
inadequate hearing room.

One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.
He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is
always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied,
""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a
demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the
pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his
mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and
several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors.
(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)

The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were
about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers
from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got
closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A
cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the
crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker
was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.

Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet
saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up
to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills.""

First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to
testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students
had some curfew, I guess).  

Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long
guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of
his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to
non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock
folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed.

Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle.""
The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well
that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,
and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery
corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed
that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was
lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining
states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as""
that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.

Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of
these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!""
(Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if
only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't
be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!)

Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was
there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's
reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's
almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the
ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were
judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the
spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)
He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the
right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(

Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a
CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a
restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining
order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction
-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor
of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,
""I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to
get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have
convicted.""  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous
performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.

Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable
every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated
purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.
""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some
congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that
it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the
vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn
card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the
law-abiding instead of the crook.

The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.
Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining
order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any
bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He 
was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One
of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was
vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in
the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every
year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...""
It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been
more effective.

At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.
Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because
the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was
disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had
to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public""
testimony; the other got a seat this time.

Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the
state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.
He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that
his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great
quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state
computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used
against the renewable FID card.)

Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had
been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he
got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and
said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General
Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how
50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women
needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was
granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether
the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be
satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather
than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long
rambling circumlocution in response.

Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks
something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining
orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue
restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they
think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining
orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.
Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.

Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a
restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she
countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have
allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.
One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be
certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga
reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go
to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating
conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)

Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his
citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver's license was a
privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.

A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice
system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public
hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death
penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public
hangings.  The speaker then responded, ""I'll make you a deal.  You get
me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.""

Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher
testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he
wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was
outside"" without his evil gun.  She said that the ""loophole"" should be
closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again"".

Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of
spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually
shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,
saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are
safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or
correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had
claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  ""Only residents can get
FID's,"" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no
idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut
out-of-staters completely off?)

Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as
written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by
out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could
be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary
somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino
underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident
student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental
record.

One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy
a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist"".  Another
(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents
from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union
had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home
state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this
resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,
""Everyone's out of step but Johnny!""

All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony
for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the
other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and
GOAL's position) were:

o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull 
   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)

o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)

o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly
   opposed)

o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws 
   (opposed)

o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)

o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)

o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)

o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)

o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)

Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining
pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.

Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger
lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee
to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.

Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.
Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,
""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it
could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It
ended at about 6:30.

There is a new product for the (IBM'ers) out there... it is called
IMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPUlSE, and is in its
3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...

you can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...
also animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)
also animted reflections maps....

you get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...

dont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it
comes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!

also....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list??
please e-mail me if you do or post up here....

oh...the number for IMPULSE is --->1 800 328 0184

Go three days early.  Preliminary acclimatization takes 3-4 days.  It
takes weeks or months for full acclimatization.  Could you be

I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here 
also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.

Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of
Moody Bible Institute:

There has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of ""arrogance"" is aimed at.

The arrogance being attacked is that we ""think we are the only ones who know
what the absolutes are"".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible on the matter of religious texts.

In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can
think of epistemology as ""how do you know?""  That question, it turns out, is
a very troubling one.

The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of
the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that
everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to
discover a source of truth is in question.

And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of
authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.


Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional
Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of
Papal Infallibility, too.)

Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and
several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and
possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute
Truth.

He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.
His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made
mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His
conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made
mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made
mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)

Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that
happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what
he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own
infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own
reasoning, that belief cannot be considered ""absolutely certain"".

Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can
say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.

Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on
your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.


This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing
epistemology: ""how do you know?""  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:

 A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.

 B: How do you know?

 A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church
    teachings and came to this conclusion.

 B: How do you know you studied history correctly?

 A: Well, I double-checked everything.

 B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?

 A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.

 B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is
    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?

 A: ...

And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say ""I
can't prove that there are no mistakes"" -- and as long as you may have made a
mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.

There is no way out of the loop.


This is where the ""arrogance of Christians"" arises: many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.

Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.

 *

People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to
find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking
the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),
but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is
knowably Inerrant.

Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire
lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The
main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by
the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been
excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city
of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter
of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto
the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle
should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of
Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks
had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the
Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd
Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
considered heretics, even though those ""heretics"" were fighting for the
cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish
hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some
hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of
Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the ""electronic""
odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to
change as any other mechanical odometer.

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple
switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,
which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)

While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.

1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake
valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after
the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time
does the pressure ever become ""negative"", or even approach a good
vacuum.

2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion.

3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty
horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,
substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost
zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is
_much_ louder than the stocker.

4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.
If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference
was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.

5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any
given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it
on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.
Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.

No matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take
the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers
have done).

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I
think the important aspect is the result.

David.

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

........
WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC

1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED?
In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The
Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future.  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This
may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of
Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.
..........

What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.
What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).
Is NASA really supporting this junk?
Are protesting groups being organized in the States?
Really, really depressed.

OK...

5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was

   I get gouged right here at $1.35?""  Accurate to the tenth of a

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

Why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  If Omran retracts his ""verbal

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have

	One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is
their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being
brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God
the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father
usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. 
	Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both
a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find
sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible
for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
each other.

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA
    announcement.

    Q. How do I become an astronaut?

    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably
    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission
    specialist"".

    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough
    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.

    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer
    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner.

    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term
    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.

    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is
    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
    Keep your nose clean.

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.

    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job
    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".

    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation.

    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.




    NASA
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
    Houston, Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    ==================================================================

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ---------------------------

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered.

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
    program.

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    ---------------------------------

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew.

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries.

    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts.

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
    payload operations.

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission
    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations.

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ===========================

    Basic Qualification Requirements
    --------------------------------

    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to
    submitting an application.

    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.

    Citizenship Requirements

    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of
    the United States.

    Note on Academic Requirements

    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic
    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --
    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum
    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's
    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,
    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.

      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the
    sciences, are not considered qualifying:
      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,
	Medical Technology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological
	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).
      - Degrees in Nursing.
      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.

    Application Procedures
    ----------------------

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to:

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN: AHX
	Houston, TX 77058

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the
    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted.

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service.

    Selection
    ---------

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process.

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment.

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,
    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period.

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for
    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not
    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA
    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a
    specified tour of duty.

    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

    Pay and Benefits
    ----------------

    Civilians

    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal
    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,
    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
    and experience.

    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
    participation in group health and life insurance plans.

    Military

    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center
    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
    other similar military matters.

G'day people,
	
	Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why
my MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, 
but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. 
	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month
mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months
now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,
but more so during idling. 
	What's its problem? 
	Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little
performance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. 

	Any help/tips would be appreciated!!


Worried.

Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow
the argument.

My point is that ""if life has meaning or importance then we should try
to find that meaning or importance"" which is almost a tautology. (I hope
I'm not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is ""Creator"",
though that is not obvious from my above argument.

(It's more like ""I think, therefore I am, therefore God is."")

Unfortunately the term ""religious"" is ambiguous to me in this context.
I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being
religious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on 
the search.

If you want ""meaning"" why not search for the truth?

So far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding
of truth. There have been many before me who have come to conclusions 
that are worded in ways that make sense to me. By no means does that imply
that I understand everything.

       Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to
give you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many
of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that
Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have
used it in the past.


      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to
discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would
not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call
to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  

      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than
me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have
been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are
lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one
persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.

     The way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was 
anything but.

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,

including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):

                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }

// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???
        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);
        XtDestroyWidget(top);
        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);
        XCloseDisplay(dis);
// ???
}

main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
                bla();
}

Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,
after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)
the 5th call to bla():

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  86

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I
get:

Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.


So finally, my question is this:

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.

Thanks very much.

Yes. As long as the goverment over there can force some authority and prevent

Sinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to
Egypth, but for a peace agreement. So it is my opinin that the settlers will not
be an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement
with the Arabs and the Palastinians.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not ""produced"": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

: arrange their affairs.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiian
word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call ""savages"".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump
the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.
So if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on 
hold, or else!! That's about it. Remember a liquid is several more times
as dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think, depending on the gas
and liquid comparision of course!

It's a fair stretch of anyone's imagination to expect them to

>[Lots of stuff.]

I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify
some things so I won't get flamed.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a
``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are
not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time.

I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''
property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have
thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means
nothing at all.

Then I wrote,

>Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus
>than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will
>keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will

What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for
a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way.

Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.

If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm ""InstallWindowColormaps()"" crash bug
once and for all, then I could say that I've (almost) unable to crash either
""twm"" or ""tvtwm"", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to

I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this
reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA
DMA.

Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using
mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter.

As opposed to Israel's many ways of death. Using bombers and artillery
against Lebanese towns and villages. Using fire arms and lethal
variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone
throwers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5
minute evacuation warning.  Using Shin Bit's ""reasonable"" physical
pressure in interrogation. And more. Not counting of course past 
practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982, the bombing of the 
Egyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za'bal factory in 1978,
the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near
the same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla.
That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs
during the British mandate period.

Ironically the same Op-Ed page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly
copied this article was running another article next to it by A.M.
Rosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively
saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring
your people slaughter. But what else would one expect from Mr. Rosenthall
who never wasted a chance to bash Arabs or Muslims.

Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences,
and that ""rules"" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a
*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is 
taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease
for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed
blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare
say all of us would be walking into walls.

Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*
careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for 
sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the
result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was
blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any
other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with 
diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as
debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a
specific behavior or lifestyle?
>

>I don't know.

Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark
about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.
The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central
message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,
and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of
our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for
our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He
has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or 
some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting
on the sacrifice that Jesus made.

In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when
I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other
socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,
no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think
it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus
healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on
this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.
She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed 
relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,
but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining
weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is
excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes
her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who
are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It
seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.

Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I 
think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I
(or something like that).

May we all experience and accept God's grace.

Beware.  There is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company
that generated is known to protect that copyright.  That image took
hundreds of man-hours to build from the source satellite images,
so it is unlikely that competing images will appear soon.

DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN

   Born 1940
   Foreman
   Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1)

   Resident at Building 36/7, Apartment 9
   Block 14
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


During the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of February], I
was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-
work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the
Nagorno Karabagh region.

After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically
in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said ""uprising"" in
Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a 
demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the 
Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even 
women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, 
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the
Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.
I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew 
wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really 
bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,
""There's unrest everywhere, be careful."" Well I had a project going on. I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on 
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they 
said, ""Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the 
police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you."" 
Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he 
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This
man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and 
afterward he spent the night with us, too.

I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, ""The situation is
very tense, be careful.""

We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I
shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's
business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it 
and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, 
they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out 
they knew what was happening in Sumgait.

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the 
buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private
drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, ""Let's go find some other way to get
there."" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait.

He took us there. But the others had said, ""I wouldn't go if you gave me a
thousand rubles."" ""Why?"" ""Because they're burning the city and killing the
Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left."" Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we 
set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, ""In fact there aren't any
Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" Well 
I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, 
""How old are you, old man?"" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not 
saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. ""How old are you?"" he asks 
me. I say, ""I'm 47."" ""I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'."" I say, ""It 
depends on God, each person's life in this world is different."" I look much
older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was
silent, too.

We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he
was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with
them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us.

I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the 
street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They
stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature 
shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .

Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's 
not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak 
their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for 
""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. The 
pronunciations are different. Anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not 
Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, 
""There was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""They started 
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the
people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" I only saw 
the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back . . .

When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,
his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""We're
Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here."" He did come up to me when 
we were pulling our things out and says, ""Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?"" 
But in Azerbaijani I say, ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" And . . . he 
left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had 
to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own 
home.

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store 
and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I 
saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I 
couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it 
was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing 
remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I
saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About
30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.

I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are
closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the
crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.
Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. 
Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the 
soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one 
armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning 
off Sumgait.

I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by 
their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I
joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us
and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.
But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly 
recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer
people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.
I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as 
to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking 
behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: ""Comrades, the Armenian-
Azerbaijani war has begun!""

The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around 
the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off 
behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, 
and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every
corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were 
doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But 
the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least
find out if my children were alive or not . . .

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the
""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return
to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.

I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in
the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just
instituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for 
a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things
that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" were
always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about
the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over
breakfast Easter Sunday.

My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music
and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee
but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong
hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong
as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional
reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual
guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"".
 
As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-
regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes
the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a
traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament
of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.
The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings
are not shared by everyone.

I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want 
them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful
service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of
Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such
as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it
is Not there.

Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"".
My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils
would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who
have beared with me this far understand what I mean.

Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not
to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something
wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or
pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to 
provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with
the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change
faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and
ministers.

In Christ,
Kershner

It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little

move that drivers make out there. We deal with it because it's fun, but

I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You
think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because
psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think
it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.
Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the
panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one
things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
due solely to sex out of marriage.

I recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out I don't really have a need
for my old 386.  I'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case
etc, so I'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide.

I'm asking $325 for the motherboard, which has:
    25Mhz 386 DX (not SX)
    8 megabytes of 32-bit, 70ns memory
    AMI BIOS
    based on C&T NEAT chipset
    	(this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are
	programmable - the BIOS' advanced configuration menus let you
	select system, DMA, bus clock, wait states, command delays, etc.)
    ""baby AT"" sized - fits in mini-tower, full-sized or most any other case
(Includes User's Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual)

For $150 more you could have the rest of the system too:
    full-size AT case with 200(?) watt power supply
    2 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game ports
    20Mb hard disk
    1.2Mb floppy disk
    keyboard
    video card (choice of VGA or ???)

If you're interested, please give me a call.  The system is set up at my house
in Aloha, and you're welcome to come test drive it.

I'll say!  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there, maybe landing
a few weeks apart.  The year-mark starts coming on for the first group.
Isn't a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential
winner?  ""Yeah, that's a shame that Team A's life support gave out
so close to the deadline.  Thanks for the billion.""

On the other hand, if Apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks

than only 1 billion to get any takers?

What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior.
That is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to
be immoral (in some cases).  Also, I've said that morality is a remnant
of evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in
the animal kingdom.

But, this doesn't get us anywhere.  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant

Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in '78. :-) It was
3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a
11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn't even make a good 600
these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the
only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS
across three states than any of the 600's.

I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12
second 400 didn't seem too far out of line.

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public 
release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical
means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the whole
point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her
communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need
be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be
quite a heist, if they can pull it off. 


I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a
panel of ""carefully chosen experts"", who would then ""study it deeply, and
report their findings""? Exactly who will these people be? Academics? Or
Government-sponsored researchers? Tiny-toons?

I can only hope that the same sort of thing doesn't start filtering over

Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.
So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice.

Best Regards,

Arno

As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.

I'd be willing to make two wagers:
1) Snow doesn't win ROY.
2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a
player, and he is on a losing team.

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this
year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to
bet...

Cheers,

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an ""Objection!"" heard
in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the
objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.

This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the ""we did it on purpose""
thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to
clarify.

Because you are not being consistent.  Moral systems must be consistent.

A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others, but doesn't want it 
inflicted upon themselves, has a double standard.  And double standards are
a violation of *any* moral system.

/(hudson)

Pain isn't immoral, stupid.  Pain itself is just a physiological
reaction.

Or brussel sprouts, for that matter.

/(hudson)

What humans are composed of isn't the qualifying criteria of whether or
not something would be wrong.  




/(hudson)
/Is it wrong to make matter undergo chemical reactions?

Yes, if it is sentient matter.

/(hudson)
/I actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will.

Fine.  I have also heard that the government is encoding the DNA for 
a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water.  

What's your point?



/(hudson)
/If humans are made only of matter, then choices are also chemical reactions,
/so why is choice an important issue.

And if that is the case, then god is only an idea contained in the minds
of people (formed of matter) and on printed pages (also formed of matter)
and does not really exist.  

I can do the argumentem ad absurdium just as well as you can, but it

It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean
the ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to 
""win the hearts and minds"" in favor of access to cryptography. 

It's precisely slogans like ""cryptography makes censorship impossible""
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough.

WRONG:  I don't think even PKP claims this one.  It is not unlawful to

I agree with your last sentence.

a little too much to be spending on each game.  But ahh, the quality...
Now I can get them for about $100, but that's still a lot.

Right now, I have:

I am interested in buying more titles.  If any of you have any interesting

Don't worry about leaks.  Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing.
Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.  Now, you'll notice, after
all the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be.

Thats why 'heli coils' were invented.  Yes, buy a few of these gems, and
rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil.
When the hole gets too big for any heli coil you can buy, its time to trade in

(Please excuse the obvious limits of the Lower ASCII char set :=)

I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box.

Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name
of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal
behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/

A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.

Unfortunately there is still a ""ghost"" of SPSS left: when I run
something like ""Write"" and go to embed an object then ""SPSS Chart""
appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all
the obvious ""INI"" files without success. The next thing I tried
was looking for the string ""SPSS Chart"" in every file in the 
Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or
REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it.

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly

in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?

Thanks is advance...

I think 
1) outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels as
large as those on cig. packages.
2) Require 30% of comparable products on the market to be free of these
substances and state that they are free of MSG, DYES, NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package.
3) While at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  For that matter why dye food?  
4) Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins.  (In my OSCO only Stress

I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a
waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.

For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperature
does water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked
if they knew what scale, and was told ""It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.
That's what all thermometers say.""  Well, that's sincere, and may be
true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT
an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should
nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth
and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time
and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion
easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of 
the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.
 
[example of head-covering in Church deleted]

This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the
writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the
instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.
The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first
century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having
a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I 
see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.
 
>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture

>Can you reconcile this?

Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.
I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes your
babies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally.  The Bible
was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us
what parts should be interpreted which way.

I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be 
able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.
The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I
know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.

I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.
I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.
Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  
I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which
God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE
absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the
original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.
Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as 
well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they
live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on 
how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that
cafeteria for lunch?  No.  

This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians
are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,
wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner
reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply
appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.

NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.
       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.
       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.
       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,
       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.
       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few 
       adults respond to this treatment.

[...stiff deleted...]

Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that
will result in the same value measured no matter the reference.  A 
bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving 60mph
will be moving at a speed of

        (a) 0mph to someone on the train.
        (b) 60mph to someone stationary next to the train.

The reference frame makes the speed relative.  But what's interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet.
Every person off, a bullet moving 60mph.  

I know of no train where all the people on it, every time it is
filled, will see a moral problem in exactly the same way.

>John Stafford 

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear
in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was 
NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of ""slip"" device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!

  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a ""stoppy""(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these
activities anymore (now that I'm an ""old guy"" with kids of my own) but
it looked damn impressive!!

  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed
in that direction! :-)

Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly ,
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life (among 
developed nations).

I am an American but I was raised in Europe, where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into, or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees.

Of cource there will be some nutcases, but thats extremely rare.

I.e. in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying.

In Germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4.00 am and not even look 
behind your back, at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen.

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying.

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere.

Of course these postings sould be in soc.culture.US but if we reduce
crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates ,thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars. (Now my posting is rec.autos.tech 
revelant).

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the
bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one
that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with
the screen.  

Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever

    Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's
as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.

Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or 
were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of 
curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as 
I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on).

I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.

just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems
to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need
to calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little
more.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you
the car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should
let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,
about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled
by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,
though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault
for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.
Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my
liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by
cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the
fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with
them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline
will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything
over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe
they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....

The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not
mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.
There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I
did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over
another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not
preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in
this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.

I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view
of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that
befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater
law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the
ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of
Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that
was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the
flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental
concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized
and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus
Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.
Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the
continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).
More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,
the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate
resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.

There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the
tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.
Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma
or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a
new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not
refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of
course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only
one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man
himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his
parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at
all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of
Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.

There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John
the Baptist,

   ""If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.""

This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching
either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to
the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did
not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (""If
you care to accept it"").  So I took care to point out, not that the
Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and
that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes
understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I
pointedly used ""repeated earth lives"" to distinguish a little from the
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word ""reincarnation"".
The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too
that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely
free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessing's ""The
Education of the Human Race"".

To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and
Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.
And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the
incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus
Christ, in my view.

Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?
Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.

Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question.

Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason
why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with
his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that
we would ""stop doubting and believe"" (John 21:27).  The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.
Without this obvious point, I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity.

Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus
says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  ""The
world hates him without reason.""  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we
need a Saviour.

And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  ""The
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him.""  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.
I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank
God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
Person who created me and who loves me.

""Assuming""? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in 
this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never 
addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is 
""right"" or who is ""wrong"", only that civilians ARE being used as cover 
and that, having been placed ""in between"" the Israelis and the guerillas,
they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.
 
	[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 
	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 
	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as
	""combatants"". So, what do you think is the ""meaning behind"", 
	the intention and the effect when an ""army"" purposely 
	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 
	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will 
	receive from this ""cover"" is more important that the harm
	that will come to civilians.*

This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying
that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians
in ""the middle"" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart
from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower
the risk to civilians.

	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves
	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves ""why set 
	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made 
	cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of

I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing
sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND
ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait 
until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that
""taking the fight *to* the enemy"" will do more to stop attacks. 

As I said previously, Israel spent several decades ""sitting passively""
on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*
the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.
The ""host"" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks 
from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks
were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact 
on the civilians caught in their path.

This is just another ""selectively applied"" statement.
 
The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis
is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your
criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.

That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for 
the ""interim"" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are
demanding conditions that essentially define ""autonomy"" already. They DO
NOT trust that Israel will ""follow through"" the entire process and allow
Palestinians to reach full autonomy. 

Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? 
If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians 
be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?
Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up ""tangible assets 
(land, control of areas) in exchange for ""words"". For this reason,
they are also concerned about the sorts of ""guarantees"" they will have 
that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.

Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the
Israelis ""word"" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being
demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party
finally gets HOLD of this ""land"", what the ""other party"" does
is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,
your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to
keeps its word does NOT get the land back.

While the ""major armaments"" (those allowing people to wage ""civil wars"")
have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still
remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and ""commando""
raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.

Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks
were commonplace.

>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.

There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively ""disarmed"" UNLESS the state
is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take
it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially
mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that
it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.

That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to ""take over""
Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.
> 
What both ""sides"" need is to receive something ""tangible"". The Arabs/
Palestinians are looking for ""land"" and demanding that they receive it
prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it
gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic
situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN
it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to
compensate for the increased risks

My 6 year son is so plagued.  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control.  But let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for 
days!  Also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute.  But again, the 
vaseline, or A&D ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.

Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don't think that rape and murder should
be dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for
leniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be
told the ""did a _bad_ thing.""

Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.
I suspect that it's pretty unlikely that, given my requirement

This is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress
sex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion (one of your ""arguments"").

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner.

I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and
the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their
stupidity and lies.    

Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as 
a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.

They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, 
whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into
town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and 
wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.
First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they
didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got
it.

After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were
coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.
Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.

Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to
them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised
Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 
 The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he
said:

""A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.
His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise
David Koresh.""

Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a
logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.

Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that
they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must
be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?

I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how
much money this was costing.  That was the start of the ""Justification"" part
part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.

But, back to the plan.  It is considered ""Cruel and Unusal Punishment"" to
execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.

They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not
sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the 
compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were
supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.

I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR
(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training
is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were
subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical 
agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.

I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of
thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.

We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these
people 51 days.  

I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole
thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks
changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:

""And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the
operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal
shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.""

It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.

One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic
weapons on the premises. 
                                                      
        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!

THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!

Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.
For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!
I hope he gets it.

Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father ""to let this cup
pass from Him"", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at
Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the
presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every
detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But
as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His
presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it
was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of
Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no
avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not
only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of
Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical
portion was only the tip of the iceburg.

BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly
king.  From John:

JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they
            began to say, ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the
            world.""
JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by
            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.

This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an
earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &
Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those
who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's
dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew
what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the
darkness of His Passion.

The window is probobly on top but the lower windows are drawing over it.
Try using WS_CLIPSIBLING to keep the lower siblings from drawing on the
top sibling's space.

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings ""near UV light"" /is/ ""actual UV light.""  The ""near"" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
""far UV"" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is
objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--
realizing the risks--is to blame.

Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this.

And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents.

But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals
on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.

Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses.

Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not
all such ""murders"" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?

But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of
society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an
execution, is it?

Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing
it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is.

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth
matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That
is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.

But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the
conviction was unfair.

Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all
possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,
but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if
we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.

>Now there's a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can know,
>and if we cannot read minds, we can know nothing.  The difference

But what we know has no effect on an objective system.

But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.
And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system.

Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.
We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible.

separating the justice system from the pack?

I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an
objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective
system is not possible in practice.

That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.

  ""Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the
  door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment.""

Perhaps that worked in California in the 60's, but as I understand the
law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space
rented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc.
(I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search
warrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).

At this point the question becomes: did the user ""rent"" the disk space
her encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same
body of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As
to whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e.,
no compensation exchanged), I don't know how it would be treated -- there
doesn't seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.

I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must 
be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of 
Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to 
the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of 
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the 
Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi
members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. 

And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following 
ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the 
veracity of the Turkish Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle 
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and 
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become 
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

If it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car
eats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the
muffler too is also ok.

>Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?

The mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check
the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.

The 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.

Well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
car with highway miles. 
Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he
has been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,
a hard driven car 6-10 sets.

Well, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty

Computer: 286-25 mhz
Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz)
Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)

                                    config.sys / autoexec.bat

                     MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1
                     smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe

CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec
Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec

I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives.
I still want to know if some (most ?) IDE drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.

PS: A friend with a 286-20 and a new Maxtor 7245 (245 meg IDE) drive gets
between 800 - 1000 k/sec (can't remember exactly).  I think the bus is running
at 8 mhz in this case.

Good story, Chuck, but it won't wash.  I have read the NY Acad Sci
one (and have it).  This AM I couldn't find any reference to
""weight rebound"".  I'm not saying it isn't there, but since you
cited it, it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there.
There is no index.  I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base,
as usual.

Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting.  Their average
seasons, using their combined average 656 (AB + BB) per 162 games:

         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830
Robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726

Fielding, we have, per 162 games at third,

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954
Robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971

Even if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
total bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about
.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.
The Thorn & Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total
           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating
Santo         123          284        -14       137      41.7
Robinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)
Usual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding
percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,
dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great
career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.
That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

Nice dodge. I give it a 9.2.

Now to answer your questions. I do not believe that there should be a
draft. The armed services should be voluntary. Can you say the same
about taxes.

I've answered your question. Would you now answer mine.

I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all 
government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the

I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally
undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw
support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.

Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an
industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it
would produce would effectively crush productive effort.

No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand
libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other
posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize
that many libertarians assume that such a government will be 
counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that
widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the
establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)

Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement

I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.

Well, in the first place, I don't support a ""socialized economic system.""
I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not
the case that ""any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt
as the buyer or seller.""  There are multitudes of examples where such a
statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions
that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one
example.

I nominate this last bit for ""Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week"".

Alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive
category, while Baerga, who studied in the Joe Carter School of Out-Burning,
has more impressive mediot stats, largely due to opportunities rather
than quality.

The lines are fairly close in value, but edge to Alomar.

Now Baerga ain't chopped liver, but Alomar is still the man to beat among
AL second basemen...

               I have a nice residential lot available.  It is approx-
          imately 1/2 acre in size.  It is located in the development
          called Belvedere Plantation in Pender County, eastern North
          Carolina, north of Wilmington.  The lot is near the Intra-
          Coastal Waterway.  Golf and tennis are located on the
          development property.  Belvedere Plantation also has a mar-
          ina facility on the ICW.  This lot is nearby to all of the
          facilities mentioned.



               I own the lot outright but it does not look like I will
          get back to the area anytime soon.  I would like to sell it
          for that reason.  Make an offer.

Nope.  Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey,
asking if people favored stricter gun controls.  A full 40% said no.
Here, in one of the most Liberal (it wasn't always a swear word :( areas

Violent solutions are passe'?  I take it you propose disarming the police,

Please don't mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK.  RKBA is about
being able to defend yourself and others, not about killing the innocent.
Actually, your mention of the KKK is rather funny, considering that the
first gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black
people...

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

This is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is 
a definition, not an assertion:

   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a 
   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is
   good. Blah blah blah.

That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To
say that something produces only good because it is only good that 
it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And
all you're application is saying that it's true if you really 
believe it's true.  That's silly.

Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under
atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-
don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.  

Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and
caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no
logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for
example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering
without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of
some inaccessible god.

By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly.
For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of
terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.
And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing
to do with it, does it?

There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.

I don't know why it is so obvious.  We are not speaking of acts of the 
flesh.  We are just speaking of emotions.  Emotions are not of themselves
moral or immoral, good or bad.  Emotions just are.  The first step is
not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God
accepts us.  It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled
it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those
afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  Give in?  Calling
his arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action
because of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving?

Re-think it, Aaron.  Don't be quick to judge.  He has forgiven those with
AIDS, he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
appropriate choices for action on such feelings.  He has not given in to
his anger.

I assume that you are talking about the appeals processes, etc.?
Well, it should be noted that people who are imprisoned for life
will also tend to appeal (though not quite as much in the ""final
hours.""

Anyway, economics is not a very good reason to either favor or oppose
the punishment.

You know ed,...  You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing
Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the
Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for
Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample
evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,
and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the
Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject
in this post), the name ""Clipper Chip"" seems very confusable with the
""Clipper"" chip of Intergraph.

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was
a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,
notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph
acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back.

When I first saw ""Clipper Chip"" in the announcement, I immediately
thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not a
lawyer. I'd say I'm a cryptologist, but I don't want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime.

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely ""abberant"".

Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the
details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls
were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
""consented"" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases.

As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases).

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level 
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.

Chew on that awhile.

	---this file last updated..4-21-93---


WHAT IS OTIS?

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
and distribution.  Digital immortality.

The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
there...and someone will dig them up.  
 
If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is 
breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
 
Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what they're here for.

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE?             

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  
 
 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site
		
	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 
	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)

Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin""
command to make sure you're in binary.

OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North
America....the following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff...
	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?
              
What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put
it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,
it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works
are also welcome.

OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  
GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  
you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format. 

OTIS also accepts animation files.      

When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
emailing).

If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send
copies to:

The OTIS Project
c/o Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha, NE 68124-1113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  
Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named, include those as well.  
 
Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
contact me and we'll arrange things.

If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5""
disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,
but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or
JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
not have to.

At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
get a slab-o-OTIS.

As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
Email me for current archive size and directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION?

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images.  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

USE?

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for    
the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the 
Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email
me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact information.
 
When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING IMAGES?

Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep
the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number.
Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CREATING IMAGE FILES?

When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,
address or other information you'd like people to know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HMMM?!

That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed.
Your input is expected.

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  
 	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original 
 	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  
	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone
	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  
    	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS
	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights
	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 
	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 
	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     
	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is
	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or
	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 
	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        
	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific
	     permission for this sort of usage.

	[Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
	algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
	for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
	16 Mbits a second. [...]

	F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
	N, a 30-bit serial number
	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:

  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Three questions:
1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:
		E[M;K] = 64 bits
		E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits
		E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits
   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,
   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?   
   All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications
   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 

2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?
   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,
   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?

3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?
   Does the block have to be present at all?
   Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,
   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's 
   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets
   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)
   
   In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?
   (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)
   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;
   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.

   On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,
   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,
   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?


	Thanks!

First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see 
a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't,
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him
to show up to teach.

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.

The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best 
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

Subject: Drawing Lines (inverse/xor)
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 40

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:

   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);

Then to draw I do:

   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?

I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming
down to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one of
the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was
that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the
basic definition of humanity, then Jesus ""fully human"" (Nicea) would not
be ""subject to sin"", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,
because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish
between ""human"" and ""fallen human"" makes Jesus less like one of us at the
time we need him most.

First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they 
were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical
record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as
extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)
claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing
(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,
in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son ""uncreate"" -- surely even 
Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's
opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed
that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require
two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because
Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,
if you accept ""Nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,
a la Chalcedon.

Second, I am not sure that ""Nestorianism"" is not a better alternative than
the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation
that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think
rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate
nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine
nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature
prevailed.

Comments on the above warmly appreciated.

Jason Albert

[There may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  The
original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call
Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that
Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by
not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do
not have to sin in order to be human.

I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I
agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think
that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in
fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was
not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of
the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he
got the better of them.

However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to
Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least
""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""The Christological Controversy""
refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As
regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an
impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I
think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from
Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says ""To attribute also
to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics
of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,
either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the
Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and
Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the
idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine
Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some
degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his
fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off
on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us
who perpetrate the falsehood.""

It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between
humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based
on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have ""to some
degree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it
must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'
participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of
identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an
incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white
terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this
area.

You say ""I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's
human nature was in heaven.""  I don't think that's required by
orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

G'day all,

Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/

and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation :-)

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and
crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewing/animation.

Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W
for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for
Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.

Any help GREATLY appreciated. Ta muchly !

If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,
then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does
the authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself
authoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, 
the mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians,
i.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the
authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.)

      AH! But what, exactly, is ""inherently abhorrent"" and WHY is it so?
What you're saying is, in effect, ""I think some things are repulsive,

should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period"".

      Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with
you. But I do _not_ agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'
immoral; they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason, and if
the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.

      No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all
belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another
story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence
to moral absolutism (of a flavour).

It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and
neither are their moralities.

      No, it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was ""created

  I'll start with a parable.
 
  A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comes
over, they begin talking about religion.  ""So you believe that you understand
God?"" he asks.  ""Yes, I do,"" she replies.  ""Then have him build you the 
birdhouse.""

  I don't think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian 
belief.  However, there is a tendency among Christians to say, ""I have all the 
answers because God gave them to me.""  This is simply not the case.
  I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However, our HUMAN interpretations of
the Bible are necessarily in error, because we are human and imperfect.  We
have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we are
human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  To
claim, as so many people do, that the existence of the Bible allows us to
determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully
understand God's will.  This is hubris.

  I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are
perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are
quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into 
misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an
analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan
War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.
  I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of 
Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an
understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who
were led to Christianity by argument?

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),

I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.

First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.

Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so
this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to
solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.

In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems
Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By
""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus
the original problem.

There are two small problems with this approach. 

	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.

	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
	other words, will it halt?

	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is
	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable.


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known
Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an
acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)

From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)

Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this).

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is

OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""

Whether there is a ""why"" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager.
If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely
wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we
don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives.
Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another
5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small
that it is scary. So by searching for the ""why"" along with my friends here
on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.

What if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing
who the host might be? There might not be a host, you say. I say let's go
find him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay.

Because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the ""why"".

than ignoring it. Some Christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile
to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from
them. To quote (of course out of context) ""Test everything and keep what is
true.""

Who compared Quayle to Gore?  Mark said he had never heard of any incident
in which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before.  I mentioned
another incident.  (And if the media had a liberal bias, I'm sure he would
have heard of the Quayle incident.)

If I was to compare Quayle to anyone, it most likely would be Elmer Fudd.

Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of
non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,
but it's still no more than a guess.
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers.

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a
miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  

You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging
attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you
r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.

740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph. Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I
believe the Beetle corners better. 

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever.
I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.

Not sure how long the small shit-box Volvos last - too damn long. The worst car I ever drove was a hired 340. In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
from the 50s, without the character. The 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough. I ought to go
for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.

Subject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 5.
Nntp-Posting-Host: gozer
Organization: SigSauer Fan Club 
Lines: 94

Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.

Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that
Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National
Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge
asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because
of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.

The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently
ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither
by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.

The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,
who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person
named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as
an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
in his dealings with Randy Weaver.

Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an
Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two
then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in
time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons
transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he
(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the
White cause.""

The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and
later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second
meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to
tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-
gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of
19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge
shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of
24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel
length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver
is reported to have said that he could perform better work once
his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility
of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars
for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty
dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have
simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -
over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).

The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that
his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead
of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver
suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in
Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince
Weaver otherwise.

The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were
made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these
meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also
reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki
Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must
have also been phone taps.

These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and
loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's
attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to
make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a
case at all..."" according to the rules.

Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his
wife's voice on the tape.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear
accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the
Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect
this trial is not explained.

Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning
Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are
surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were
surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained
in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy
Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that
Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report
that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming
at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics
are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the
only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and
Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that
Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.

Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. 
Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'
countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will
get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the
capabilities of the base station.

The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but 
cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular
calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another
base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled
call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant.

But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant
to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see
above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,
but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,
it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop
listening in'...

You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
sucking) and Nixon.

Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers.  Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
signing.  And don't tell me Boston will win this year.  They won't 
even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.

I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.
If only those christian ""scientists"" would take note.

(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian 
scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly
true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified
by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are 
trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the
error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed 
light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been 
accounted for. :-] )

>	The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a 
>modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.

Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never 
intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one
up?

Millions of people have ""died for a lie"".  This  point is difficult to 
substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments
work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed 
themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory
of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.

>Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.
  
That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)
to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to
the claim that Jesus was the ""real thing"".


>	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
>to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example

Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the
point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his
many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based 
(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with 
his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler
was sane....

Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a ""Therefore...""

This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with
people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think
people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of
metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to
present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or
she will end up in all sorts of shit.   

Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe
the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, 
who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the
book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say ""a is
equal to b because a is equal to b"".

  

>	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  

That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed 
in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all
claiming to be correct.  

It

I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames
than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments
of a stranger should be of interest to other people. 

Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one
rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I
could probably find the exact quotation.

Cheers,
Charles.

You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt.
USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the
position and size.

You say: ""Tom, don't blow a gasket, what's the harm?""

Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window)
when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.

What, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that
there WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES? Every break they took back at
the studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey
instead.' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they
have a feed for tommorrow night...

Point is, be glad they showed hockey, but if baseball was available
anywhere else you can bet you would've watched baseball last night.

Subject: Re: Prayer in Jesus' Name
Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA
Lines: 39

According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking ""in X's
name"" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today
would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized
to conduct business ""in John's name"" had full authority over John's
financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to
work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was
not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with
""in John's name""; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney
and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal
and religious definitions of ""faith"".)

With this cultural background, praying ""in Jesus' name"" does not
mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous
""fiduciary"" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His
Kingdom.  The message of ""praying in Jesus' name"" is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's
delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and
responsibilities.  This idea of praying ""in Jesus' name"" is not only
present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal
forumula is absent.

The act of praying the words ""In Jesus' Name"" may be beneficial if
they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the
advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready
to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.

Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,
etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by
Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or
C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to
contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His
omniscience and grace.

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,
I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)

>See the ""Spreading Christianity"" thread, in which he says I

Dean did not.  He called them ""the Great Commission"" but this is NOT
descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.

Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:

	""And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
	from your feet.""

Matt. 10:15:

 	""I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not 
 	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with 
 	that town.""

In the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:

""> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on
 > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.""
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^

The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.

And Dean countered:

""Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an
intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I
specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty
to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two
statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to
characterize that as ""ignoring"" the instruction to spread the
word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.""

Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of ""instruction
to spread the word.""

All these quotes btw are from:

Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>

>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question
>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology
>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).

And I claim it correctly, because my question went:

""Do you, too, measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?""

and the closest Dean came to an answer was:

""Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is.""

Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:

""So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really
doesn't take much sophistication to understand.""

On top of which, I doubt that the ""answer"" is at all representative
of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's 
mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.
One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this.

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread:

""You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the ""sins"" of other individuals.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.
That I made public announcements of the ""sins"" of others
--""sins"", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in
the posts of others-- is a different matter.

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so
I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,
YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.

Dean again:

""You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to ""paint Jews as plaster saints,"" thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.""

Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.

I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about ""plaster saints"", 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.

In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as
the basis of one insult after another.

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.  I'd like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message 
server, and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it, since the Sun-supplied
textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.

However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For
example, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview
knows nothing about drag and drop.

The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,
dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:

        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro

So, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?
I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.

Please reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough 
interest.

	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do

	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the

	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive

I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most
basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement
relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that
assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not
compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.
Falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows
corrupting both the intellect and the heart.

If there is a God, he has nothing to fear from truth.
As to imaginary gods and there followers: Be afraid. Be very
afraid.

    April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world
are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members
by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.  
    At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,
and it is important to note that those who deny that this event
ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate
the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,
would like to see it happen again...
    Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCR/Scanner Fund.  We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:

John Sorenson
Carol Sigelman
Carla Moore
Barbara Moose
Judith Schrier

Again, thank you to all who gave!

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  
It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners.  

When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; 
(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) 
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.

Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The 
software gives you two ""errors"" at this point.  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  
Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted 
correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, 
you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. 

After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
seperate TIFF or PCX file format.

I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use

an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  
While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the 
accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. 

Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just 
too small. 

If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., 
Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, 
Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, 
malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, 
salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those 
in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and 
minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
(3). 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious 
Diseases."" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as 
surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and 
public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).

            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     From November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 
laboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O157:H7 and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada. 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain. Washington 
     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a 
case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls 
implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset 
(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 
18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated. 
     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-
February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case 
definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS 
(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with 
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating 
a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 
through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 
developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years 
(range: 0-74 years). Idaho 
     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December 
11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were 
hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 
(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California 
     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. 
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and

four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was 
reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% 
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 
1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as 
postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, 
or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. 
     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The 
outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen 
persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median 
age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of 
the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community 
controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched 
OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients 
who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-
sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). 
Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada 
     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools 
for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After 
SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient 38 days after illness onset. 
     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine 
were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: 
0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-
matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during 
the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence 
limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients 
also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-
49.8). Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 
19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on 
November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 
lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 
(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other 
food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been 
implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 
participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen. 
     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients 
develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. 
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). 
When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public 
health action to prevent further cases. 
     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices 
are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). 
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. 
coli O157:H7.

            Use of Smokeless Tobacco Among Adults -- United States,
                                     1991
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). Long-term use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). 
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, 
CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This 
report summarizes findings from this survey. 
     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20 
times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the 
time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or 
equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) 
(3). 
     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) 
women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan 
Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American 
Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only 
for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). 
     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of 
chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although 
women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. 
     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being 
former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were 
former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons 
aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 
(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% 
CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users 
was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 
95% CI=68.9-78.1). 
     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) 
currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% 
CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% 
CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. 
     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 
95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-
49.6).

Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National 
Center for Health Statistics, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in 
particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). 
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). 
     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous 
study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. 
     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 
2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more 
than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, 
enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based 
prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

Dear Rob,

>When I read Brian K.'s postings, I find someone who is honestly seeking
>the truth.  When I read your response here, I see condescension.  When you
>reply to a post, reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines
>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).

Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  ""Brian K, please step aside before you get run over."" 

BK:  ""There is no truck.""

Me:  ""Turn around at look.""

BK:  ""No.""

Me:  ""Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck.""

BK:  ""No. Explain to me why trucks exist.""

Me:  ""Turn around or you will run over.""

BK:  ""No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.""

Me:  ""You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.""
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  ""It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.""
      And by the way, I really have an open mind.""


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. 

Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My
wife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.

Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040

I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the
examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.

Make sense?

Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared
for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup
section says Apple 14"" and 16"" monitors can go on top, but 21"" and other
big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the ""partition"" button
on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly.  The ""getting more information"" section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.

 Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase

Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often
explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in
contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus
('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and
implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of
language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's
thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary
framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features
remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being
transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving
us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own
account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that
any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to
talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but
a threshold.
  vonWrights's comment that Witt's ""sentences have a content that often lies
deep beneath the surface of language.""  On the surface, Witt talks of the
insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing
ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with
Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes
in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more
perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it
is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to
offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his
Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse
of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. 
Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about
our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.

  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in
it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of
understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of ""as a man thinketh, so
he is.""  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,
that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals
of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that
there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too
are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the
individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to
Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the
one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the
Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has
the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not
only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things
of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep
things of GOd that are absolute and true.
   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced
and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because
if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that ""aura of deterrence,"" critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
""contribution to society.""  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to
neighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA)
I found that there were few states in the provences that stood
out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to 
name the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin
stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have 
always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.
And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that
state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the
same.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left
with me about their neighbors.

The only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is 
whether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between
cheese and serial killers :)

Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as
a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall
hearing recently that it was about to happen.

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a

is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the

I don't personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which I didn't have access to).

The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.

The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a ""this is how
well he hit *last* year, in major league terms"" rating.  So, in essence, he
has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.

Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place

Sure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the

in contention.

If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training
could interpret as ""failure"".  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.

Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,
then did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.

You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets

Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.

Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent
Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald
Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.

The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy
Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although
Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy
must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is
the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.
Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies
between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.
Cooper conceded that, ""You have all these things compressed into
a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.""

Cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm Colt Commando submachine
gun with a silenced barrel."" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]
Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific
plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.

When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's
M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for
sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.

Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)
had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, ""If
you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,
counselor.""  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of
the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by
killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's
virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions
were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained 
that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the
defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge
sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted
until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to
admonish both attorneys.  ""I'm not going to play games with either
counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start
acting like professionals.""

Spence told the judge that, ""When all the evidence is in, we'll see
that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that
he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events."" 
Spence continued, ""We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely
similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between
the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.""

Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated
objections would prevent a fair trial, ""We can't have a fair trial if the
jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm
bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm
violating court orders.""

Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's
objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and
denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict
his comments when objecting.

The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg
Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five
weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized
on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.

Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned
Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific
plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then
had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton
had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon
was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.
Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,
but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, ""I did not conduct
the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations
with him since the interview was conducted.""

Monday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled
is the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

Might the problem not be with the video monitor instead?  Many of our

   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.

Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road
like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.

In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport
riding.

So what does that have to do with RBI's?  The team with the most RBI's
doesn't necessarily win the game.

Yes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does
every newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)

But for an individual player, runs and RBIs are context-dependent, and tell
us very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and
position in the batting order.

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of
doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5
different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?
Just curious.

Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 36
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: pesto.mit.edu

Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out
there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.

Thanks.

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though...

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in
on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*
25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any
particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of
padding).  
All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, 
so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
*
Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
Excellent - IE-""As you find them in the store""
Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
Good      - On down the line
Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still ""decent"")
Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).  
A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing (usually the insert)
I'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the
final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until
the bidding stops)
*
Again if you have any questions, ask away.

Yes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith
(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced
of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal
revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those
beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to
accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the
conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs
arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God 
must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are 
rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient 
for them, or because they wish to spurn God.

I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one 
holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is 
that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with
God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas
of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or 
revealed that truth.

Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed
interpretations of our observations (perceptions).

Values can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science the
value of 1 is TRUE, and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreed
values (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a
reinterpretation of these values.

The values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been
fully agreed, and the change with time.  The values of Newtonian physic are
certainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics.

   PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in
that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a
mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there.
The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and
to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the
rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.

In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed 
de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a 
genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The 
result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In 
the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the 
successful genocide of the Armenians.

Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...
Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of 
Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as 
""rebels"".

Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.

Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims 
Armenians were a ""threat"".

In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of 
approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.

Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish
population.

The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these ""real""
platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad

new one, cheap, and I am very tempted, but it will be a waste
of time if I can't drive it using a standard video card.

While I'm on the subject, what's everybody's reccomendations for
a 21"" color monitor. I've heard good things about the NEC 6FG, and
of course, there is always the reliable old Macintosh 21"" display,
but what are YOUR experiences.

I don't know about everybody else, but to me, they should have been

Note that I _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the
nuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex.  I specifically
said that it was ""a prime cause"" of this, not ""the prime cause"" or ""the
only cause"" of this -- I recognize that there are probably other factors
too, but I think that extra-marital sex and subsequent destabilization
of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in
psychological problems, including depression, in the West in the 20th
century.

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as
wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at 
Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or
Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance
that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our
University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did
not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead
to be a legitimate charge.

No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee

better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.
Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is

If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost

for a billion a year ""if the wrap were gone"". This merely points out a

Dear Will,

I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok.
I had a few thoughts!:

""Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead"" - James 2:17

Faith is both belief and action.
If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a
swimmer? and will people believe that I am?
Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a
Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to
God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!

In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6
v3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands""
I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have
come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and
we cannot help but obey what He says.
I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing
us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically
produced in our lives.

Hope this helps.

I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have
supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the
future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to
decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating
high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not 
going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the
real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business
reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that
we're not the main threat.

I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon
could possibly be called ""classified.""  It's like handing out military
secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked ""don't open me.""  I can
imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to
a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.

Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable
for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?
In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you
just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect
on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of
that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that
it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search
algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.
I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  
However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its 
designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion 
of such techniques seems credible.

Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name
""Clipper"" for this device. :)

Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. 
(If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)

This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should
never be satisfied. It does not imply that
having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.
It does imply that I sin every day.

A perhaps simpler definition:
Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments: 
love God, love your neighbor, is a sin.
Anything I do that is not from love is a sin.

The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.

I could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them,
considering only to teach them proper behavior, or I could yell at my
kids out of anger or selfishness.

I could post an excellent article because I am interested in sharing
my opinions and getting feedback and learning, or I could post an
article because I want everyone to realize how wise I am.

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.

   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?

   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   

Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic
halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)
(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was
probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.
	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence
isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-)
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)
and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.

	If we know anything about physics at that level,
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.

The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace :-)

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...

I totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally.

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
""the real world"".

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions.

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.
Values are ... well they are what I value.
They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience
rather than not, and so on.

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone.

>If there is no such thing as objective value, then science can not 
>objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head.

I don't agree.
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the 
perceptions :-)

>Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
>to be more useful than a set of tarot cards.  

I don't see why.
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or
can't be shown to be accurate.
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.

No?

Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named

Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President
Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the
Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives
from government and industry and academic experts from across the
country to participate in an independent review of the redesign
options being developed by NASA.

""I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this
important review panel. America's future in science and
technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost
attention and care,"" said Vest. ""We have assembled a diverse
panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate
measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical
task.""

The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing
various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's
redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve
efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space
station international partners also are being asked to 
participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory
committee will submit its recommendations in June.

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs
or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

%%% Memory info %%%

Physical RAM size: 20480K.
Logical RAM size: 20480K.
Size of Low Memory Area: 8K.
Virtual Memory: Inactive.
Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use.
32 bit System zone: Absent.
Parity RAM: Not capable.
Growable System Heap: True.
Temporary memory support: Present.
Tempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.

Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?
How can I turn this on?  Any ideas?

Can anyone help?

Indeed, CDs are bundled with it.
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications, games, photos, etc.

I have compiled a list of these and posted it to alt.cdrom.

Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this
growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the
investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from
any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been
behind it.  What's going on here?

Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.
I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops
because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business
negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR
knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a
psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had
professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was
emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from
civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their
isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious
orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as
the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being
consumed in the apocalypse.

IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated
psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of
action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly
appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the
tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,
obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push
him over the edge.

Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV
earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical
role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno
on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)
claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true
they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they
were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and
reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at
the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and
would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the
""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image
that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back
and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.

Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without
bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency
interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation
of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.

The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,
abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the
armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited
his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A
simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell
how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not
have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the
compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the
FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the
revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without
all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to
show the world how big her balls are.

Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my 
very soul.

You know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic.
The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap
and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without
any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve
the ""yeast"" problem once and for all.

Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms.

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?  I'd hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this.

Organization: Software Metrics Inc.
Lines: 76
NNTP-Posting-Host: rodan.uu.net

This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an ""OS"").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.

Please, I beg you. If you know anything about the Caere Typist Plus
Graphics Hand Scanner, Please read and solve my problem. I will be
truely grateful for the rest of my life!

The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not
connect to my PowerBook 160. The Cable on the Scanner will not fit into
the SCSI port on the PowerBook.

I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSI
port. This, however, turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated it
as a hard disk.

I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable. The idiot,
out of sheer laziness has taken 14 weeks and has yet to solve the
problem. 

I am aware that Caere Co. in the US have a solution.

Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem. Please help me if
you know the solution. I will be forever grateful to you.

	The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
refer to both Christians and Jews.  Christian fundementalists are
often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in
Judea, Samaria or Gaza, and to any Jew who follows the torah.

>	Actually, Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfile

Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge
this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished 
of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only 
the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian 
Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of 
Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines 
genocide as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a 
   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' 

History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including 
U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of 
the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,
beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian 
territories.

The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government.

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were
Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,
Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

 in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places
 selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs
 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
 Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not

 Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

You said it worked so well with tobacco.  I was being fascisious(I can't spell

20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches.""
note what it does NOT site as a factor: PRICE.
int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI {from the
article it seems you get plug and play SCSI-1 only since SCSI-2 in FULL
implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices.}
SCSI-1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play

        Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm 
asking for help.  I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to 
one, unless it can take it; however what about if I've got a 24-60v 
stepper.  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a 
small schematic would probably be helpfull).  
        Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) 
current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as 
that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully 
help me with).

Well, certainly in Archimedes case the description ""while observing the

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to
piss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..

I just read a good book, ""Tower of the Gods"" Interesting..

I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate
respond to the ""Charley Challenges"" (and judging from my e-mail, there
appear to be quite a few of you.)  

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or
unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between
the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or
more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.  

It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions
will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the
subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I
would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,
in the following manner:

1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the
Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he
refuses to do so.

--or--

2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it
something similar to the following:

    ""Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.""

Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some
honest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to
ask from a devout Christian, would you?  

Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 9: Other Miscellany

This is the ninth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.
We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu 
as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography 
FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers 
every 21 days.


Contents:

* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?
* What are the US export regulations?
* What is TEMPEST?
* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?
* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?
* Is RSA patented?
* What about the Voynich manuscript?


* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?

  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It
  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and
  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is
  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,
  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of
  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break
  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national
  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.

  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of
  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the
  difference between public and private research in cryptography:

  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,
  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged
  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10
  years has there in fact been widespread open research in
  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts
  between these two research communities. Open research is common
  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with
  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,
  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can
  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?
  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would
  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one
  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have
  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which
  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''

* What are the US export regulations?

  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control
  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export
  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by
  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office
  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized
  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule
  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent
  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see
  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.

  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting
  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what
  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which
  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to
  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
  least heard of the ITAR.

* What is TEMPEST?

  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that
  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at
  quite a distance and with little effort.

  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
  is available this way.

* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?

  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for
  corrections.)

  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas
  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving
  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the
  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.
  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;
  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;
  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.

  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various
  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:

  The Beale Cypher Association
  P.O. Box 975
  Beaver Falls, PA 15010

  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the
  line:

  send index

  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.
  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher
  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,
  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)

  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of
  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI
  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.
  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this
  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an
  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this
  string.

* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?

  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis
  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes
  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in
  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,
  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.

  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;
  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent
  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.

* Is RSA patented?

  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.
  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been
  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral
  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information
  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of
  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as
  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other
  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.

* What about the Voynich manuscript?

  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the
  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list
  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>

  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich

  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of
  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's
  ""The Codebreakers"" gives a good introduction.

The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being
a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this
area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that
people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like
that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.

I agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you
most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.

I'm looking for a better method to back up files.  Currently using a MaynStream
250Q that uses DC 6250 tapes.  I will need to have a capacity of 600 Mb to 1Gb
for future backups.  Only DOS files.

I would be VERY appreciative of information about backup devices or
manufacturers of these products.  Flopticals, DAT, tape, anything.  
If possible, please include price, backup speed, manufacturer (phone #?), 
and opinions about the quality/reliability.

Please E-Mail, I'll send summaries to those interested.

Thanx in advance,

It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in
their signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your
posting). Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid
addressing ladies with ""Mr."", as you have done.

Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has
never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed
of Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and
the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's 
military intervention to it under international agreements.

Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what
is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist
policy that Armenia is now pursuing.

But, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political
conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as
""itchy-bitchy""...

I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive
evidence that the puck _did_ cross the line.  And, the replays I saw showed 
fairly conclusively that the puck did _not_ cross the goal line at any
time anyway.  Somebody screwed up.

-*----
I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand
on two of her comments.

In article <C5JoDH.9IG@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:
> Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,
scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these.

Past snippets from this thread:

>>> I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....

>> He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would
>> distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from
>> one in which it does not. ...

Back to Lee Lady:

> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and
> sci.psychology.  According to these posters  ""If it's not supported by
> carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.""

These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A ""carefully
designed and controlled study"" is neither always possible nor
always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a
remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we
have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind
of claim to ask for a ""carefully designed and controlled study""
to alleviate our skepticism.)

Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To
reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic.)

First of all, the chip doesn't do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second,
which is far beyond what you need for voice.  It's obviously intended
for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.

Second -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone?
I don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have 5 years from
now.  They can't update every Clipper chip that's out there.

Third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it would probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  If
nothing else, that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  The
V.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly-
massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you're completely out
of the ballpark.

You can probably get this information by calling your public health
department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free,
as well).  There are bulletins in medical libraries that give
recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section
of the medicine department of your local medical school.  You also

I think you would lose your money. Julius was actually rather tall

Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90
or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards.

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as
far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred
to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more
professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars
running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal

autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you!

>have no respect for their own lives.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much
over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much
safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

Who is the you Arabs here.  Since you are replying to my article you
are assuming that I am an Arab.  Well, I'm not an Arab, but I think you
are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The
bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is
very consistent with its policy of intimidation.  That is the only
policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in
the middle east!

I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering.

Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-

1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches.
I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools

and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of

Just my two cents worth.

Well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and
propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,
we shall be moral unto what end?

Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.

Well, ""objective"" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts, while ""arbitary"" implies no clear line of reasoning.

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

I would like to submit the following which helped me enormously.
If it has already been posted, I apologize.

It seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to 
explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water.
Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor.
Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.

And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I
also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three
ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and
an employee in a business.

Thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on one's particular
need for Him.

I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They
obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is
responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip
release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists.
BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)
Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability
or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret
development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further
backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software
will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture,
along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.

The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking
it back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media
for propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if
Clinton's agenda succeeds)...   Those that do not play ball?  Waco

stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum
for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  I don't recall
spending a lot of money on guns, etc being illegal ... yet, that is.

Clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to

my $.02 - Yes and No.  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible.  
Either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else 
they are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.
   Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are 
so committed, nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can 
come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements.  This 
can be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.

Regarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church 
(at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks 
about their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of 
concern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).

   Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if 
you catch the two meanings.
   I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either ""on fire 
for Him"" or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made 
aware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children, not eternal 
damnation.

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.
You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses
as you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from
the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.

It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However, I would make 2
remarks: 

 - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
 - It's not only 'arab' governments.

Now, about taugh talk and arrogance, we are adults, aren't we ? Do you listen 
to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? 
I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they
clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86
blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:

1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find
oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term
that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a
few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with
preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.

2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of
what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to
unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to ""sell now and save on
taxes.""  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar
advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice
was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),
but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates
(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).

It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe
accurately what happens in the real world.

What ""it may think is right"" may be exactly what the user wants.
Assuming that your application ""has reason to know better"" is, IMHO,
anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are
you going to ignore that as well?

There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
if it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's
no guarantee that you're going to get what you want.

University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for

No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly 
people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated 
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 
1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide 
that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought 
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian 
terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that 
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
today.

A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri 
town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to 
have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military 
operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the 
Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been 
massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten 
and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed 
the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian 
insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the
Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City 
hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant 
were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to 
condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its 
sovereignty.

This posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.

The point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have
clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue;
specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
the Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live ""morally straight"").

There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't
control their race but they can control their behavior).

What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?
Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or
worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious
and moral standards on which our society has been established and on
which it should continue to be based.

Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
and armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been

your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the
testimony of people here, some Lebanese, who have acknowledged
that they know of no evidence for these allegations.

It depends which of those territories you refer to.
In general, settlers were moved into the territories because
at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the
logical move.  This is not to say that views don't change
or that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that
the only ""disputed territory"" that does not appear to be temporary
is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M, which is the one I am using at

It has been done already!

In the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with 360K disks in the first few
years and then later 720K disks. In order to make life less complicated,
many freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this. Side 0 of the
disk had 360K on it and could be read  by any ST. It also had a flip-side
program. This would swap the sides around so that side 1 became side 0.

                                  So that the
                                  Prophecy be
                                   Fulfilled

                                     * * *

       In considering the Christian religion, and judging it
according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in
the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even
about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in
the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the
authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at
least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much
happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we
will take particular claims at face value.

Immanuel:

       We begin, of course, at the beginning.

       (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you,
       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is
       salvation), for he will save his people from their
       sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had
       spoken by a prophet:

       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),
       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made
       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not
       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz
       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its
       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the
       lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz..."" 
       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,
       naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But,
       Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a
       test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of
       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that
       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord
       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman
       is with child and will bear a son, and name him
       ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil
       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to
       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings
       you dread will have been deserted...

Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. 
Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), as
specifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about the
Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years
later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In
short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of
context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It
should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general
manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,
virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,
the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by
later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by
the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy
for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second
class prophecy.   Not too convincing.

Egypt:

       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a
quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he
wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an
alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.

       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of
       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:
       ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""


What the lord really said was this.

       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. 
       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called
       them (my people), the more they went from me; they
       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning
       incense to idols.

Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it
was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to
return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of
here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind
up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy
is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.

Rachel Weeps:

        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that
King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of
all young male children.  Matthew then writes,

       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the
       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

       ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud
       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;
       she refused to be consoled, because they were
       no more.""   

The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the
carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722
BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,
and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""no
more.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies
before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.
       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who
was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and
Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,""
it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is
that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,
""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).""
       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely
that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the
event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,
nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. 
Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less
evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a
prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance
the message of the church's gospel.
       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the
infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set
up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.
It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention
the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophet
speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd
comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be
returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this
would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are
dead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not even
that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too
convincing.

The Nazarene:

       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find
another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife
take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, 

       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets
       might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""

First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of
the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is. 
There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,
there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still
worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at
all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that
she will,

       [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor
       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his
       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel
       from the hands of the Philistines.""

This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. 
But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has
begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is
simple making them up now.

Bearing our
Diseases:

       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses
and disabilities.

       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the
       prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our
       diseases.""

As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,
and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,

       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has
       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.

From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that
the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation
of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the
Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations
that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish
identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the
instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.
      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and
discipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around and
healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the
sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,
as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The
verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but
rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed
that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear
the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say
that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his
spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel
misses where he intended it to have its effect.


Silent Messiah:

      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus
ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse
the attention of the local rulers.

       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by
       the prophet Isaiah.   

       ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,
       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on
       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He
       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear
       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised
       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings
       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his
       name.""

The Isaiah passage quoted reads,

       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my
       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my
       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the
       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or
       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a
       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will
       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail
       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has
       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands
       await his law.

You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,
because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could
never think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankind
burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to
an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace
G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will
be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed
from the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to the
Christologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While the
original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it
to fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If one
has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only
to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed and
plundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at
""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.

Three Days and
Three Nights:

      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very
mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and
resurrection.

       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the
       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son
       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and
       three nights.

Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know
how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was
24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset
6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from
6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time
scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until
6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their
sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. 
(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that
Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,
when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight
portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,
Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three nights.

      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninth
hour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the
grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,""
before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was
over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for
clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before
6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm
Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means
using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two
nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this
is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we
are even able to have his death involve three days and three
nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to
suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little
mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his
god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more
than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.

Hearing &
Understanding:

     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in
parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if
you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the
message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand
them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not
accept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,

       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in
       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, 

       ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you
       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this
       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of
       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they
       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and
       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal
       them.""

The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his
call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is
flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. 
Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,
calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.

       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this
       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and
       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this
       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their
       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear
       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
       turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long,
       lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste
       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the
       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far
       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And
       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned
       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still
       stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its
       stump.

Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel
to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the
promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read
the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan
of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look
at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)
     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion
of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,
he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't
understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are
not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the
present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. 

     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they
have the prophetic approval.

       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a
       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the
       prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I
       will utter that which has been hidden since the
       foundation of the world.""

Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a
prophet, but from the Psalms.

       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will
       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have
       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. 
       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to
       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the
       lord...

As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come
from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies
of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. 
Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some
of it up.
     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once
again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus
has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not
understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. 
Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have told
us.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of the
world.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. 
This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No
wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,
Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,
Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the
only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.


Excuses of
Little Faith:

       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go
around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what
epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were
unable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more
enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying
they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this
demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or
he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move
mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can
move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the
Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to
Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old
woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.

       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in
ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their
sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in
heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  

     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time
or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the
old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the
theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see
God anymore.

       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're
       sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our
       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right
       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...

     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear
reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be
true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your
heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is
make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say
our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they
say, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see the
lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people get
lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday
sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is
not seeing G'd the way people used to see.  
      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of
human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the
forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created
by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are
what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody
has little faith.

Jesus Rides on
an Ass:

       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah
king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into
Jerusalem.  

       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken
       by the prophet, saying,

       Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is
       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a
       ass-colt.""

Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little
differently.

       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and
       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-
       colt... he will command peace to the nations.

There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah
only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for
both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a
comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two
donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,
proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written
earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to
Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and
shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has
bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I
have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,
the situation is often reversed nowadays...

       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were
angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,
Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,

       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of
       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'

It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus
was never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things AND
since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to
fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or
Matthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,

       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is
       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is
       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you
       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the
       enemy and the avenger.

The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise""
spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,
not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be
just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic
scripture.

YHVH said to 
my lord...:

      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish
messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king
David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,

       ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until
       I put your enemies under your feet.""

Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic
descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of
course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to
make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine
nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one
is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. 
But, there are problems.
       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the
messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the
messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures
about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,
bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's
rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the
passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the
Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this
psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had
also made.  One must remember that there were various factions
among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the
messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like
his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and
who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.
What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,

       YHVH's utterance to my lord:
	""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your
       footstool.""

       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule
       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer
       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the
       holy mountains.  

       ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek
       forever.""

The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian
bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the
word is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means
""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in
the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an
address of respect.  
      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word
refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is
supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the
psalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm about
David.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court
poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the
psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be
talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended
from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive
tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any
praises of a messiah.
     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after
David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of
favour for David's kingdom on hold.  
     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was
promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,
successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved
the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,
enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.
      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,
though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though
his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this
event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off
a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,
though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of
Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. 
Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of
an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we
might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by
embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.

Moses & Jesus,
Had it Together
All Along...:

       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a
pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John
deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed
from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. 
But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early
church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah
king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made
by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of
a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this
was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the
Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the
promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.

       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,
       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.

It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,
Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. 
I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament
which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the
course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like
his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has
many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they
still cling to it.

The Potter's
Field:

      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by
one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,

       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver
       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief
       priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for
       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood
       money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to
       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was
       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,

       ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the
       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's
       field, as the lord directed me.""

This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament
Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name
of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which
Matthew makes use of.

       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,
       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast
       them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I
       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of
       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of
       YHVH.

First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer
of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely
a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people
shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with
one another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the King
James Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this made
Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The
correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which also
makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter's
field"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was
intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given
Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of
intentional dishonesty.
      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the
text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if
as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard
the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to
toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high
priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the
treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the
opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,
the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New
Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing
enough.

Wine, Vinegar,
& Casting Lots:

      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.

       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,
       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not
       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they
       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that
       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,

       ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my
       vesture did they cast lots.""

First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour
wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find
that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him
some to drink --not polluted with gall.

       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of
       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the
       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he
       had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""

But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the
prophets, but one from the Psalms.

       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;
       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me
       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and
       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add
       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no
       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the
       Book of the Living.

Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request
of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm
quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It
is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that
we run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in the
psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas the
Jesus of the gospels says,

       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the
       don't know what they do!""

Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by
having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his
meat, as the psalm stipulates.

       With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally
ask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22nd
Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to
say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no
great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon
in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least
erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does
indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of
Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,
his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some
suspicions.

The 22nd Psalm:

      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his
condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of
praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it
seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We
will examine the primary passages.

       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! 
       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words
       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you
       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.

Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. 
This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather
than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not
fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as
complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""the
lamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much
groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by
both day and night on the cross.

       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... 
       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag
       their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let
       him deliver him... for he delights in him.""

This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the
exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.

       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their
       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.

       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and
       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my
       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.

       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my
       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the
       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my
       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!

It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian
fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,
this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" really
do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,

       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my
       hands and feet...

In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb form
which can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  The
word in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari),
which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal
imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that
would urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, to
add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this is
just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to
Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the
translators.

       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend
itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being
saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the
psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather
the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional
thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on
his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.

      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not
attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these
scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down
is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian
theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful
fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might
have been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,
it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good
things for St. Matthew.

The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's
crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after
the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,

       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his
       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...
       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...
       ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""

Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of
context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of
Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with
them.

       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...
       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations
       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will
       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on
       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have
       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him
       like you weep over a firstborn child.

John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that
Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more
than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and
blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel
writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their
religion were founded.


Reckoned with
Transgressors:

       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming
the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of
the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.

       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,
       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the
       scripture was fulfilled which says,

       ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""

Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,
about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the
messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its
surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The
verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the
past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The
servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the
description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the
messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus would
more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was
considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to
steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could
have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.

       Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with
[Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a
couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke
decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,

       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged
       with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save
       yourself, and us!""

This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the
people who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that the
robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,

       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,
       ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same
       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,
       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. 
       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,
       ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."" 
       And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you
       will be with me in paradise.""

Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches
the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather
strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his
punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,
apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have
been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by
Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  
Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy
enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made
up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free
words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another
example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and
expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,
the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have
seen.

The End of the
World--
       Mt. 24:

       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all
three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most
unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus
mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and
his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world
which he has been warning about.

       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's
       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your
       coming, and of the close of the age?

       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for
       many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ.""  
       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for
       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,
       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the
       beginning of the birthpangs.
             They will deliver you up... put you to death,
       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This
       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a
       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.
             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the
       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to
       the mountains.

             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,
       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from
       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man
       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out
       his angels... and gather his elect...
             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its
       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know
       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these
       things, you will know that He is near, at the very
       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not
       pass away until all these things take place...
             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the
       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,
       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming
       at an hour you do not expect.

From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in
within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells
them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it
will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet
their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. 
But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his
disciples that their generation would still be around at the End,
and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be
swept away.
      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant
nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generation
shall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will not
pass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used many
times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. 
It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,
he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is
quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at
least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. 
The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking
at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from
Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus
meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.

       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th
chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000
years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,
hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. 
Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how
tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for
just the right moment to spring?


       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,
(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or
three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three
eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for
less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine
radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best
interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore
disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. 
As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when
people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,
Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have
seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout
Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple
belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with
argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question.  To question and investigate has never been the
easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the
prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely
accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. 
Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity
have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support
wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which
Christianity can securely keep hold.

       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: ""Don't think that I have come to
       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,
       but rather a sword.""

Ironically, the domino theory in fact *was* a reasonable metaphor for
the collapse of communism, from the liberalizations in Poland and
Hungary to the border crossings in the summer of '89 to the fall of
the Wall later that year....and then to the ultimate collapse of the
USSR.

    I've been using the Build59 drivers on a GW2K 4DX2-66V for several
weeks with no problems. I'm running Windows in 1024x758 and all software
I've run has worked fine. This includes many games and the CD-based 
multi-media encyclopedia, on which the full-motion video works fine.
I'd recommend you give them a try.

DEPOSITION OF ROMAN ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN

   Born 1954
   Senior Engineer
   Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association

   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 40
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy, an awful tragedy for us, the 
Armenian people, and for all of mankind. A genocide of Armenians took place
during peacetime.

And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in
those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.

On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there 
was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we 
didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they
wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd 
near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home 
watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir 
Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our 
house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields
there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the 
direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and 
started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off 
the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the
light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know 
and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.

Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:
there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother
Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War 
II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.

We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down 
with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, ""What's going on? What's 
happened?"" They say, ""Armenians, get out of here!"" We don't open the door, we 
say, ""If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow."" They say, ""No, 
leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!"" By now they've 
broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best
we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. 
We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,
and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and
when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no
police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We 
held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an 
axe, and then with a crowbar.

When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them 
with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, 
pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father 
in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the
room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother
Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he
was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured 
several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But 
they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there
were many of them.

The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go 
into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought 
skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father 
bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, 
and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw 
that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove
them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the 
bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in 
there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to 
chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of 
about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and
Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and 
started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through
the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no 
one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader 
of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a 
fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: ""What's with you, 
woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?""
She says, ""What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!"" My father 
was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian 
and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, 
""The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he 
brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person."" He says, ""You 
don't need to shout, stop shouting."" And when they heard the voice of this 
man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and 
started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, 
too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't 
know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even
though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started 
to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to 
call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all 
evening and all through the night.

Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were 
from Khachmas. They said, ""We heard that a group was here at your place, you 
have our condolences."" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay
in the room.

So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,
we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around 
one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, 
investigators. They say, ""Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back 
here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.""
Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take 
Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take 
Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,
but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the 
neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should 
hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and 
went up to the neighbor's.

The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,
ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a 
landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A
crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings
19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking 
into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians 
weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they 
poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were 
some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. ""They're up there, still,
up there. Let's go kill them!"" They broke up all the furniture remaining in 
the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding 
one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door 
shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling 
the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, 
and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, ""No, that's from some of the 
furniture."" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed 
him down.

The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and 
went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also
Armenians, they had left for another city.

The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, ""Are you 
crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the 
apartments? They could kill you and them!"" And to us :"" . . . Come on, leave 
this apartment!"" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At
first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and
he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound
of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went 
downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the 
other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. 
They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal 
they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our
Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.

With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were 
saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely 
accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the 
crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only
able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on 
the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We 
were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our
share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the 
troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been 
even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the 
genocide.

Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the 
leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their 
orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '
pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock 
in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was 
quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried 
Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were 
about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It 
was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people 
there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being
taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, 
there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It 
was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The 
child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible
to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a 
man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces 
were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...

Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what 
happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my 
father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.

I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was
established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what 
happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.

I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They
even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel 
mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They 
weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our 
troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right
across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The 
inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the 
soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They 
weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were 
at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket 
office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing 
Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that 
they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department 
came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though
perhaps they could have come and saved us.

As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus 
station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in 
fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in 
which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had
lists, the bandits. You can tell that the ""operation"" was  planned in advance.

Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the
leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian
people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops 
suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my 
family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait
Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would
have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.

At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR
Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest
possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could 
happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted
out for such deeds.

Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass 
disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,
very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There 
were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took 
part in the pogrom of our building all in all.

They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that 
retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.

Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game.
Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away
with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.
LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.

LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.
The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.
LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.
Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.

Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won
the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.
The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored
three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.
They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by
Paul Kariya.

The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also
proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU
goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by
both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.

This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one
month.  The Bradley Center holds approximately 17,700.

      Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm.

      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon.""
The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably

Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.

>The facts are that Morris

Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.

>You can go on about what Clemens has done in the 
>past and claim that he is ""better"" than Morris if you want to.  But 
>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens

What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

You are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  
showing the same behavior.

I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  
about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  
rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  
have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.

The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  
engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  
part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  
rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   
Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  
the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.

This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  
manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  
cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this

Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'?

Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established 
a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two 
continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and 
Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in 
espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and 
Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under 
German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National 
Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional 
Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, 
Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often 
expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,
during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication
in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!

                  'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy

   Washington (REUTER) - President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a
plan to plant a new ""Clipper Chip"" in every government telephone and
computer line to prevent eavesdropping.

   Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National
Institute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial and

the encryption devices would be assigned two unique ""keys"" - numbers
that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.

   The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the
keys are deposited in two ""key-escrow"" data bases. Access to them would
be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,
kept harping about how they ""must have had a different view upstairs""
because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who
saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay ""judges"" initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is
unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year.

cordially, as always,

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  I
really wish I could believe in him, 'cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own, the universe *is* a big place, and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it...

I've gone into this with an open mind.  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt, and I've prayed to see what
good that would do.  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god, short of just deciding to believe for no good reason.  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason, why not believe in some
other god?  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...

All I know is that in all my searching, even though I've set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept, I have never had any encounter with any
deity, Christian or otherwise.

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler ""economy"" tire, the ME77. Good
for mid-size older bikes. Rated to 130mph. Wearing well and handles
my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit 
more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport
Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the
front, and $70 for the rear.

Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?

Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.
I took him to a local ""Urgent and General Care"" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The 
clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not 
see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed 
here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several 
trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:
	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,
	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
	  to the emergency room;
	- the doctor would not even speak to me;
	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;
	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said ""I don't know.""

I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but
I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still 
trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.

Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.
The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple
encryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'd
mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)

Mind you, I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which
certainly casts doubt on your choice of words.

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called. 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred
them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).

> ... Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
> intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners"").

I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.
People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but the
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we
are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,
but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a 
different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do
not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt crept in.

Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] 
should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels""?

I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David
was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath
was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.

Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what
he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.
I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that
his whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the 
Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything
and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say
how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.
Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.

Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid
getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing
adultery, we can control our own desires. 

I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other
people see this.

(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)

Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just 
as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslims
worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"".
Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. 
Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little
more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater 
to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but
you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more
I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my
conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's
conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology
then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Are there any former (or present) ""Eastern Religion"" members here 
who could comment?

I've made no such claim.  Please direct my attention towards any
posting of mine where I claimed superior sources of information.
It's probably because I bothered to post any references at all while
others seem content to post numbers pulled from the ozone, that
you've confused it with fact-twisting.  If so, I apologize.  

: then take those twisted numbers and twist them further by trying  

Well then, here's fair opportunity for you to prove that I've ""twisted
numbers.""  On what grounds do you contradict those references?  Do you have
any citations... any sources of your own that I can take similar
gratuitous shots at?

Excellent point.  I hope to God that Ted Simmons doesn't get the weird
idea of trading for the guy.  And if he does, he had better not
include Jeff King in the deal.  Oh God--what if he traded Zane Smith
and Jeff King for Vaughn and Greg Blosser?  It would be worse than The
Nichols Curse!

Hmm, I guess that doesn't sound sincere enough.  Oh well, at least I

      REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES 
                             VIA THE INTERNET
 
NASA is planning to expand the domain of users of its Earth and space science
data.  This effort will:
 
  o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U.S. Global Change Research 
      Program including the Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) and the Earth 
      Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Programs.
 
  o   Use the Internet, particularly the High Performance Computing and 
      Communications Program's NREN (National Research and Education 
      Network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of 
      science data and images and value added products.
 
  o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in 
      cooperation with other agencies (especially NOAA, EPA, DOE, DEd, 
      DOI/USGS, and USDA). 
 
  o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development 
      communities. 
 
The user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) as
part of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g.,

Howdy

We have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with
4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think 
Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok
(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell
network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program
will not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%
and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram
talking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.com
thing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machines
with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)

Anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have
quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours
with Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft
didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.
Somewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd think
with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all
the possible problems, but I guess not...

Microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General
Protection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so please
don't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they
said, and still no luck.

So.  If you can help, please mail me.  This problem is driving us nuts.
I will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.

Thanks

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
""the people"" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  ""... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ....""
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 ""The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.""
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask ""well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?""

Well, ""militia"" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
""militia"" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   ""The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time.""
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   ""And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States.""
     - Noah Webster, ""An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution"" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  
odd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,  
but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a

We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods:

2) keeping olwm, but putting ""wmTimeout: 10"" in the resources

It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..
detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,
Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might
be of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift
gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is
good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..
it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,
unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her ""poor little engine"" way
too hi :-)
Just my HO's..

Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting ""Christian Love.""

I don't see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people? What
happened to the tribes of the Americas? Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West, particular in the US with its failed ""melting
pot concept."" Most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic. Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened.

Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of 
my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least 
favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a 
great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower
this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and
Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the 
Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  
Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching 
staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the
difference.

On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some 
baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked 
where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied ""Fair.""  I 
remember it being in the ""They Said It"" section of Sports Illustrated.
I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

	Well, Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps. He had one
good **playoffs** (not season). oh well. The Caps are notorious for making
stupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades.
Sigh.

Cote, as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already.

Please!  I'm begging you!  Quit confusing religious groups, and stop
making generalizations!  I'm a Protestant!  I'm an evangelical!  I don't
believe that my way is the only way!  I'm not a ""creation scientist""!  I
don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails!  

If you want to discuss bible thumpers, you would be better off singling
out (and making obtuse generalizations about) Fundamentalists.  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists, you would think that they were different religions!

Please, prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the
same, so please don't write off all Protestants or all evangelicals!

You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention.

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible.  So was his sophomore year.

Sheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing ""have ERA's that are 0.40 lower

   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes.

   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
   ran the heading: ""Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery,"" which has been echoed by several other reports.
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
   the 20% magic of the ""placebo effect"" would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,
faxes and phone calls.  Certainly, with our way-cool Internet powers of
organization, we can act in the same way, if such action is appropriate.

As long as we are kept informed of events, anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action.  Hopefully, we're a strong enough community to act on
those calls.  I realize this is a little optomistic, and I'm glad EFF is
working in the loop on these issues, but don't underestimate the
potential of the net for political action.

I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said ""once

They are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
""product"" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some ""trusted"" pair
of escrow agencies) has to have the key.

Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our
cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the
government.

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order.

Bad analogy.

This is not to argue for or against the proposal, but rather better
distinctions are required in thinking about it than ""house key, safe-deposit
keys, etc."".

such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has

and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not

 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic ..

 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc.

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215

 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)

and

> means ""hang oneself"".

Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will
find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I
recently checked several Lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is
""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best
references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).  

The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and
the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in
words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""
In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it
specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then
notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He
presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by
hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is
denoted as the result). 

By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":

> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice

> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.

Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the
Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. 
It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the
correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence. 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,
I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it. 

By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:

> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.

Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change). 

Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:

> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather

> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
> obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
>          ^^^^^^

True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took
the money box, but rather said:

    ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling
     him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something
     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
     it was night.""

Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I
believe that the house of cards is comming down). 

Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.

By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the
mention of it in Matthew), you say:

> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
> this with you.

I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we
are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
these issues.

    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible
    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.
    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely ""possible""
    reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the 
    best you can do is say that the Bible is ""possibly"" inerrant, not that 
    it *is* inerrant.

Just how much do you usually have to pay for a little

    You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2
seconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn
at first but it is quite simple to open.

    Well, if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some
problems. A close look at the socket should give you an idea of the
proper orientation of the chip.

Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.  According to Mike Lang and good old
Stagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they 
winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark.
I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular
season games.

However, you are right that the playoff streak does carry over from
last year.  And with 1 more win, I believe they tie an Edmonton record
(but don't quote me on that one).

The balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
some air resistance.  When they were finally punctured, this 
preasure (and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain
a spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to
catastrophically deflated.  The large silvered shards
that remained were easily visible for some time before
reentry, though no longer useful as a passive transponder.

Obviously, you really don't know.

They *have* spoken out (cf Sec'y of State Christopher's recent trip to the ME),
they have provided millions in aid, and they have participated in the airlifts
to Sarajevo.  They *would* supply military aid, if the UN would lift the embargo 
on arms sales.

     I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail
access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more
relevant than I, who have none (yet).

>1.  Ages & sexes of children
     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl

>2.  Do you spank your kids?
     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.

>3.  If so how often?
     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something
very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running
into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has
not been spanked yet.
     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course
I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.

>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?
     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall
why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time
to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the
impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the
fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -
is called a spanking.
>
>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?
     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared
a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made
sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him
lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.
     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep
arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.
I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they
calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're
really young.

>6.  Your age?
     40

>7.  Your location
     Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.

>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal
>offence?
     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to
teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use
that as an excuse to hit too hard.

>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid
     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never
used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they
were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,
none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.
     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that ""what
ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.""  The Bible also says in all
things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)
There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with
at times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved
a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the
devil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid
to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's
forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that
what I had done was enough punishment.

Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6.
Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are
156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW
to create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er
2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be
""shown-up"" by the Schwabians.

PS- those MB engines haven't been released over here yet.

       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does
not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly
acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money
being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)

>Or vice versa if you aren't a Republican. 

       So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some
of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only* 
responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which
is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)

       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.
In any case, we're talking about *education*.

       Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the
situation.

       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing
down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial
celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise
unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.
 
       I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education
problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack
of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a ""tax heaven""
and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see
a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.
The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average
teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)
the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an ""Education crisis""
in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic
programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)
while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an
unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education
is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to
but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children
than ugly art.

      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of
bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions
had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)

      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.
So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency
with fairly broad powers, including the veto.

      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.
Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good
thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.

      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for

       No, if the ""progressives"" don't want the ""reactionaries"" to move
backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of
people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'
very effective, especially since it is usually geographically
concentrated.

       Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer

Hi all!

You didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA on

Constitution.

Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of
    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost
    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to
    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers
    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of
    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government
    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military
    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are
    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments
    are afraid to trust the people with arms.""
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right
    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A
    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free
    country...""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of
    the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
    a year.""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing
    armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the
    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be
    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large
    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****
    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""
    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they
said ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Right
of the Militia""?...  ;-)

> Your average 
> 17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition.

You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and
probably females under current interpretation).

The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well
regulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check
how _well regulated_ I am.

> If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep

Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that
was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a
""well organized militia"".

> It could be

What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set

> instead of a separate sentence?

Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist
Papers?! 

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General
    Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
    recital of particulars.""

But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He
only wrote it.

That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist
Papers.

Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organized
militia"".

That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*
weapon currently in use in the armed forces.

But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.

    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This
    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,
    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or
    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""

    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate
    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August
    1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the
    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...
    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of
    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order
    to raise an army upon their ruins.""

So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
our Liberties and Rights.

Fred.

	Try reading a bit.  THe government does lots of multi year
contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses.  They just like to be
damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract.   THe reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much
as they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough
Multi year contracts,  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out.

Look at SSF.  THis years funding is 2.2 Billion,  1.8 of which will
cover penalty clauses, due to the re-design.

Tony-

I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other
typical""Christian"" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will
con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may
be unaware of all the statistica ""findings"" concerning African-Americans that
have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias
against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,
but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.
Fortunately African-Americans had ""whites"" who supported their 'cause' and
public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was
even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them.

I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,
that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,
including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,
and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular
to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes
in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually
sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially
within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such.  I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it.

In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one
case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they
began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.

I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0
raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values
Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner
support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more
oppressive legisation against gays.

Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the
Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions.

The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even
hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change
the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a
""conditional"" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an ""unconditional""
love, one that calls people ""just as they are.""  Sure there are things that
will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things
like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to ""other
people's expectations."" In the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuper-spirituality.

This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,
but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.
Gay people are not criminals.

Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic
church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-
admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently
been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were
voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing
happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends
recently told me he was ""approached"" by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.

These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in
Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
Colorado called ""S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T."" (I forget the whole definition off hand,
but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto
is ""Working for a fag-free America"" with an implicit advocation for violence.

This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are
embracing.

We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from
organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good
purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people.

The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include""
people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,
especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto
itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

Whatever

But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a
non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both
sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.

The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from.
Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right
(and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.  

Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently
to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get
offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.

(BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)

Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their
mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines
because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of
discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine
and we can all live peacefully.

I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above
16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a
variety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it.

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the ""wrap"" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.

Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.

Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?

As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.

Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?

Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.

I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.

No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position.

perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his
continual discussions of this topic -- surely he doesn't feel you
should be _pressured_ into something you feel uncomfortable about
(since christianity should be a choice one should make on one's own).
please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship -- he
probably feels you are missing out on something great, and wants to
tell you about it.  but since you know where you can learn about
christianity, you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that
choice, and if the choice is no, you should be respected for that.
personally i believe that a christian's mission is just to be
christ-like, showing his/her own faith and happiness in that faith,
and make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it.  i
do not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others -- but then again

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!  

Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.  

Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance.  Don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information
before you do!

If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process.  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of.  Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby?  If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to
read your ultrasound study?


In my opinion the process should involve a OB/GYN and a radiologist.

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a ""Goodyear Blimp in orbit"".  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here

Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better
than Lopez is also no more than speculation.  It *does* make
a difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not.

Though this is a good point.  The one speculation is ""safer"",
because it can be reversed.

There are 2 books published by M&T BOOKS that come with C source code on
floppies.  They are:

Programming In 3 Dimensions, 3-D Graphics, Ray Traycing, and Animation
by: Christopher D. Watkins and Larry Sharp.

Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C
by: Christopher D. Watkins, Stephen B. Coy, and Mark Finlay.

I have the first book and it is a great intro to 3-D, Ray Tracing and
Animation.  Most of the programs are on the disk compiled and ready to run.

I have only glanced at the second book but it also appears to be good.

Hope this helps!

I'm not a lawyer but to the best of my understanding, the Congress has no
more rights than what is enumerated in the constitution.  That is the 
prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue.
Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and
the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.
U.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular
authority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not
arbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into
effect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality
of law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was 
never constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be
unconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law
being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct
me if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone
convicted of breaking that law is absolved.
   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has been
invalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate
level{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton}).

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I
can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are
""in part"" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
has about the player.

And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
and yet...

Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet
Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion 
of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical 
documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, 
was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, 
program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and 
radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people 
of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the 
lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is 
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their 
lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations 
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and 
prosperously.

------------------------- letter ----------------------------------

During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which 
not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the 
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, 
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order 
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, 
which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide.

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;

5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;

6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new 
generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically
mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through
all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the 
armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in 
the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier).

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 

Hope that helps,

As a matter of fact, yes I do or at least I strive to.  I will not
be so proud as to boast that my faith is 100%.  I am still human
and imperfect and therefore, liable to sin.  Thankfully, there is
opportunity for repentence and forgiveness.

Sigh.

Farwell LA, Donchin E. The truth will out: Interrogative polygraphy (""lie
detection"") with event-related brain potentials. Psychophysiology
1991;28:531-547

""The research reported here was supported in part by contract number 87F350800
with the Central Intelligence Agency. Preliminary reports were presented at the
1986, 1988, and 1989 meetings of the Society for Psychophysiological Research"".

Donchin happens to be an Israeli.

Do you really think that Israel needs something as primitive as torture when it
has THIS as well as something brought over by a Russian mathematician from the
Lenningrad Military Hospital in 1979  (factor-analysis of multiple unit
activity of the brain) ???  Surely you jest.

When Israel sics trained dogs on Arab prisoners the way it's commonly done on
prison farms in Mississippi or Alabama, *then* you have a right to protest
against torture. When Israeli security personnel beat Arab prisoners the way
Chicago police do, *then* you have a right to complain. Since it does NOT
practice physical torture in any way, kindly refrain from using this word.

Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of
his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or
something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold
would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800;
now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind
because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.

The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and
forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if there
any of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that can
pretty definitely be said to have not come true?

as someone else already mentioned, don't ""carry thru"" the other 23 pins.

plan A, minimal null modem:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
if you're transfering files betwen 2 PCs, this ought to work (unless
you have a persnickity comm program).

plan B, null modem with modem control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything.
such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call.
with this cable, each side's DTR will drive the other's DCD.

plan C, null modem with hardware flow control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.

plan D, deluxe null modem (combine B and C):
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
this one is ideal.  it leaves out DSR and RI (rarely used anymore).
if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend,
you might add:
	FG(1)   -  FG(1)

the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors.
i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy.

The new LeBaron will be based on the Mitsubishi Galant, which should

The new PL compact will have a convertible option (also a chrysler

At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not 
mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of 
Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan 
the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.

Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one, 
although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as 
being a reference to Satan. (I haven't read Ezekiel throughly in a long 
time.)

It only falls apart if you attempt to apply it.  This doesn't mean that

If you are managing PC's on a Novell network, get the network management

Among the many features, you'll find utilities that can help you to

Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My 9600 baud

acceptable speed...

What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so

Yet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner

The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.
If your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper
block from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x.
 
This is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there
but the card is a real ask kicker in my book. It beats the hell out
of my junk Sony 1604s to the point that I can't even use above 648x480
mode much...Sam
Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a Sony
with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. Or installing 60ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!

are you serious? pitchers are pinch-hit for in the nl.  they are not in the
nl.  if a pitcher is cranking in the al, he will stay in the game.  if he
is cranking in the nl, he may not - ESPECIALLY if it's a pitchers' duel,
and his team needs an extra run.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides.
When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk,
I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion 
if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not
justified at all in others opinion).

When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride 
and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree 
or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?


And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That
is not a blame, just a remark.

Is this guy serious????

If he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops I forgot that the media
   for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts 
   are known, as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe). 
   Any ways one of Koresh's DEVOTED followers that DID I REPEAT DID survive this
   ""GENOCIDAL MASS-SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE"".  Besides there are nine 
   survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that David
   was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  Besides, a majority of 
   these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,
   this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).  Also
   someone should have told David and his followers that if they can't the heat
   then they should stay out of the kitchen!! (pun intended)

Ocean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West
Space News, April 5-11, 1993, p.2
[Excerpts]
     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months 
March 30, confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. 
     The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from 
Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. 
     However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers 
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. 
     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western 
observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the 
last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was 
launched.

by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova
     Moscow, 30 March -- The Cosmos-2238 satellite was launched at 1600 Moscow 
time today from the Baykonur by a ""Tsiklon-M"" carrier rocket. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told at the press center of Russia's space-military forces 
that the satellite was launched in the interests of the Russian Defense 
Ministry.

     Moscow, 31 March -- Another artificial Earth satellite, Cosmos-2238, was 
launched on 30 March from the Baykonur cosmodrome. 
     The satellite carries scientific apparatus for continuing space research. 
The satellite has been placed in an orbit with the following parameters: 
initial period of revolution--92.8 minutes; apogee--443 km; perigee--413 km; 
orbital inclination--65 degrees. 
     Besides scientific apparatus the satellite carries a radio system for the 
precise measurement of orbital elements and a radiotelemetry system for 
transmitting to Earth data about the work of the instruments and scientific 
apparatus. The apparatus aboard the satellite is working normally.

Not to drag this out anymore, but....

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.

A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.
Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to ""prove"" that
the disease exists.

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:

1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5
months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So
these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans.

2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy.

Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so.

Precisely.

There's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.

There's no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.

There's no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.

I consider it to be a useful fiction; an abstract ideal we can strive
towards.  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it doesn't
actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not
be too far wrong.

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not
be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
""virtually impossible to test for.""

Indeed, I would be surprised if ""candida overbloom"" were such a
phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature
byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite 
tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient
or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as 
""virtually impossible.""

Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.  You started 
from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of
insanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  Recall, one
survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene 
lamp.  Kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no?

It's not entirely far-fetched.  Nobody outside the compound would know 
EVERYBODY inside the compound.  Don't forget, the BATF admits having 
agents inside the compound, in any case.

 Sigha.
 
 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are 
there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a ""slip-in"" bulb replacement)?
 
 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my ""not damn near bright enough"" 
incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and 
picked up this cheapo ""Motorcycle battery and charging system tester""... 
Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on ""Very good charge""... Start 
the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's 
supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery.
 
 My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...
 
 Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?
 
 Is there an easy fix for this?
 
 3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can ""hiccup"" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

We had a similar problem in converting a .EPS file. The solution was simple.
We changed the first line from %!PS-Adobe-3.0 to

This fouled the converter, the .EPS file only contained very simple

Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of
those car hunters?  I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted
by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  

They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't
be talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything
about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if
they didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since
I charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,
I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork 
to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.

I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
good news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been
over week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of 
companies? Anybody care to share their experiences?

these?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular).

1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.

2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches
   set but it is much slower.

3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.

4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
   cases.

5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.

6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)

in Internet land might be able to help.

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would
like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my
/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,
so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message
along the lines of:

Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket

Any ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The
pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply
suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and
I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there
is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits
Pat Burns.

If you were Pat Burns what would you do?

Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments
on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic
idea...

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success
will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have
any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the
hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples
skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.
He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  

Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.
I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.
These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour
should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a
nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  
Score Gilmour score!

Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??
	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line
	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)

* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up
		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,
		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then
		let them play.

** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.
** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.
** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and
out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.

The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.

The weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
(very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning
up time after time.

However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if
you follow it you will probably wind up in jail.

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our

Proper counter to this claim:  ""Forensic analysis of the WTC bomb by

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny, 
my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess
whether ""Mohammed"" was anywhere to be found.  I don't think so.

       As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police
release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate
federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they
weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.

       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

       What people say they want public today may not be what they
say tomorrow.

Later on, in your posting, you make reference to ""putting words

paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely, that I,
along with Greg, claim that Gainey never made a technical
mistake.  If you actually read what I've written, you will find
that I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well,
you're contradicting yourself.

I'm really sorry Roger, but you have lost me completely here. 
Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ,

I'm wrong AGAIN...hmmm, let's see...where was I wrong in the

that you've setup a ""You're wrong again"" macro key on your
machine.
 
I agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but I
think you know what I'm getting at.  I would also like to point
out that Gilmour's potential as a Selke-winner was never part of
the debate...are you asking me for an opinion?  If so, I think
there are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour
among the candidates.

Possibly because gay/bi men are less likely to get married?

What was the purpose of this post?  If it was to show a mindless obsession
with statistics, an incredibly flawed system of reasoning, and a repellent
hatemonger agenda, then the purpose was accomplished with panache.

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, ""I'm Polish, not Jewish.""

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).

Well, it's said that people get the government they deserve.

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It
really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had
no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in
8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is
*faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to
C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures

before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists
that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.

Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.

> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of

The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large
negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
described circumstance) is near zero.

>I can find the figures if you don't believe me.

Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported.  (""Gun cleaning
accident"" is police-speak for ""the family needs the insurance
money."")

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have
which is 3.5"" 600RPM!!

I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B 
computer. Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm
(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow
for the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also
change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!

Hopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 
quid and upwards ....)

The drive is a JVC MDP series drive ...

That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father', 
we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is
usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities.

Hi netters,

My friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX. There is
a local dealer here in Seattle selling them for $22600, with
Touring package, that's $7400 off from MSRP. He thinks it's a 
very good deal (and I think so too). Since he knows I have access to
the net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially
in the area of reliability and maintenanability.
Please send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.

My opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:
auto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),
full wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)

Thanks in advacne!

Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed,

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls.
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control.

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted.

The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's!
What the so-called ""eco-freaks"" want to do is to simply bring those
fees in line with current economic reality.  Currently, mining companies
can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices --
something like $50!  The mining lobby has for decades managed to block
any reform of these outdated fees.  In fact, the latest attempt to reform
them was again blocked -- President Clinton ""compromised"" by taking the
mining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate
legislation to fight that battle.
If you want to discuss this further, I suggest you take this to talk.environment.

       One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof

       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.
Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't
*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate
wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.

       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority
in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House
came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in
Congress.

       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,
from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a
convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with
food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week
and I'm not on government assitance.)

>Money was diverted from programs addressing
>social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost
>plus profits contracts. 

       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.

       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion
dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of
approx. 884 billion dollars.

       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In
192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.
That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted
for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)

       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,
Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)
cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or
more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase
of 230%)

       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on
Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of
368%)

       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing
credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.

       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion
dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.

       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.

       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.

       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.

       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.

       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.

       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.
     
       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under 
the Energy category, primarily under ""Supply,"" and ""Community Development,""
in the area of ""disaster relief,"" and between the two of them
represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

       Where *was* this huge diversion?

>In order to rectify this situation there must
>be constitutional revision.

       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by
the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to
equalize once the pressure is gone?

>Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed 
>circumsatnces of the role of the Federal government. 

       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want
to continue. I see very little positive about it.

>The constitution
>cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process. 

       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic
process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting
what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the
brakes on the ""democratic process"" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's
riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense
it gets worse.

>If the peoplr want
>to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have
>it.

       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be
told, ""no,"" and pointed to their local government.       

>Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only
>leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute. 

       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that
in talk.politics.guns?

       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating
the law.

>This is a major reason why the right to own

       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.

       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of

be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)

       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't
*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've
tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred
to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions
on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were ""meant,"" but
just didn't make it in there.
     
       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.
I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that
as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.

Hello, I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a
change to read this newsgroup very often.  Anyways for my senior project I need
to convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file.  Please I don't need anyone telling
me that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I
have heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone
knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction.

Any help greatly appreciated,
Matt Georgy

Subject: Mix GL with X (Xlib,Xt,mwm)

NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu


I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are 
they using ""a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus""? 

Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
much better.
e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to   
invest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage
for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). 
Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy 
the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). 
They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them
propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it 
unprofitable.

Yes...

Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like
nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any
spot.

The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and
Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.

As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and
left.
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was
in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old
that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?
I don't think I'll over forget this story.

Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible 
studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY* 
whose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and 
unsuspecting masses?  Imagine my surprise!  I never would have thought it of 
him.

How was this terrible deceit discovered?  What exactly was the ""cultural 
interference"" they were caught committing?  Attempting to persuade the locals 
that their ancestral gods were false gods, and their sacrifices (including 
human sacrifices in some cases) were vain?  Destroying traditional lifestyles 
by introducing steel tools, medical vaccines, and durable clothes?  Oh and by 
the way, who did the denouncing?

I am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes, who seemed so nice, was 
really such a deceitful tool of the devil.  Please provide me with specific 
documentation on this charge.  There is some risk that I may not believe it 
otherwise.

Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)

	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]

Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.
	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.


Mass Acknowledgement:

The next time you go to church, you can check the better creed, that is,
the Apostles' Creed.  It says: ""the resurrection of the body.""  Should
have learned that on the first go around.  But what's a body without 
a little bit a'soul?

At the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century
point of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham
to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before
drawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part,
but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: ""tombs were opened,
and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And
coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the
holy city and appeared to many.""  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the
damned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27),
although it saw Him (cf. Is 45:2).  

Concerning the abodes of the dead, I don't want to subject my brethren
to further anguish, so I will direct you to contact me through e-mail
if you are genuinely concerned.

Your new body might be something like Adam's before his fateful encounter
with the Just One (Acts 7:52, CR trans. Vulgate): filled with infused
knowledge, absent of concupiscence, and immortal.  It would probably be
a little glorified, too.

I wouldn't recommend it.  It's really hot down at the center of the earth!
You know, the normal geothermal gradient, and all that.

Subject: Panther's President
Organization: Cybernet BBS, Boca Raton, Florida
Lines: 46

As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.
After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.

A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_
Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders.
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.

The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price 
information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the
day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and
GM.

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.

""The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,"" Torrey said.  
""Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.""

More BIO:
In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight
seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-
offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.

""I guess this completes my own personal hat trick"", said Torrey, 58, a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach.

Dear Netters:

A new religious newsgroup ""soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya"" was pro-
posed  on  Oct  16,  1992. The discussion about this new proposed
newsgroup went on in various related groups.  The  proposal,  was
supposed to enter a vote during the last week of November 92. Due
to a false Call For Votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be
canceled.  I  quote  here  a  statement  from  the  moderator  of
new.announce.newgroups:


""The current Call For Votes (CFV) for an Ahmadiyya newsgroup
 is being canceled. A new call for votes will be issued within
 a few weeks, possibly with a new impartial vote  taker.  Discus-
 sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called...""
                                -- by Lawrence, Nov 20, 1992.


A lot of confusion arose among the netter as  to  whom  to  vote.
Therefore  it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all
confusions are over. It has been over 4 months  of  that  instant
and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. A fresh
RFD is hereby being issued. Please! take part in  the  discussion
under the same  title heading  and in  ""news.groups""  or at least
cross-post it to ""news.groups"".


****************************************************************

                REQUEST  FOR  DISCUSSION

****************************************************************



NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: 
==========================

     soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya


CHARTER: 
=======

     A religious newsgroup, which would mainly  discuss  the  be-
liefs,  teachings,  philosophy  and ideologies of all major reli-
gions of the world as  they  exist  to  foster  better  religious
knowledge  and  understanding among followers of all religions as
they share common basis. This newsgroup will be devoted to  build
a  peaceful  mutual  understanding  of  the  Ahmadiyya  branch of
Islam, its peacefull beliefs, ideology and philosophy and how  it
is  different  from  other  branches  of Islam in fostering world
peace and developing better understanding among religious people.
It may also be used to post important religious events within the
World Wide Ahmadiyya Islamic Community in general.


PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: 
====================

     The following are some of the main purposes this group will
     achieve:

     i)   To discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as
          they relate to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

     ii)  To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings  of this
          puissant spiritual force on earth.

     iii) To examine Islamic teachings and beliefs in general  in
          light  of the Quran  and established Islamic traditions
          of 15 centuries from Ahmadiyya perspective.

     iv)  To discuss the similarities  between Ahmadi Muslims and
          people of other Religions  of the world and discuss how
          religious tolerance  and respect to other's  faiths can
          be brought about to  eliminate inter-religion rivalries
          and hatred among people of religions. 

     v)   To discuss the origin and teachings of all religions in
          general and Islamic and Ahmadiyya Muslims in particular
          to foster better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and
          other religious people.

     vi)  To discuss current world problems and solution to these
          problems as offered by religion.

     vii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya
          Muslim Community and other Religions.

     viii)To add diversity in the religious newsgroups present
          on Usenet.

     ix)  To discuss why  religious persecution is on the rise  in
          the world  and find  solutions to remedy the ever deter-
          iorating  situation  in the  world in general and in the 
          Islamic world in particular.

     x)   To discuss the contributions of founders of  all  reli-
          gions and their  people for humanity, society and world 
          peace in general and by the International Ahmadiyya Mus
          -lim Community in particular.


TYPE: 
====

The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo-
gue.   The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement or dissent to
beliefs, but will mainly be used  to  prevent  derogatory/squalid
use  of  dialect  and irrelevant issues. The moderators have been
decided through personal e-mail and through a  general  consensus
among  the proponants by discussion in news.groups. The following
moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:

Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu)  
Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)



A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM:
=========================================


        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-
sation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this
sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the
Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major
religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-
duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of
Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised
Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all
the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger
from God have been fulfilled.

        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and
extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-
tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-
nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect
is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.
Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many
adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who
come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.

        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about
a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-
gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-
erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi
Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-
cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.

        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-
ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed
by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's
internal resources.

        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under
one universal religion.


NEWSGROUP CREATION: 
==================

        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will
officially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If
the group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  ""YES/Create""  votes
than  ""NO/don't  create""  votes;  the group shall be created. Any
questions or comments  may  be  included  in  the  discussion  or
directly sent to: rana@rintintin.colorado.edu

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there 
*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither?

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel

important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""
be secured?

Useful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
preferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
in an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
U.S. population.  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful -- it would make for nice slogans: ""Your privacy is worth

[good points on buddhism, etc. deleted]

just because one says christianity -- true christianity -- is hard to
follow faithfully does NOT mean that one discounts the validity and
difficulty of other religions.  i admire those of any religion who are
willing to make the kind of sacrifices and dedicate themselves
spiritually in the way you are talking about. 

[more deleted]
>And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out (""woman was created

do you think this is what christianity is all about?  not all
christians believe in this particular story literally.  it sounds
above like you are supporting a policy of ""to each his own"" -- here is
another example of that.  if it helps someone's faith to take every
word of the bible literally, i support and respect that, too.

please don't judge all of christianity by one man.  the only man one
can truly judge all of christianity by is jesus (makes sense, right?).

i think his point about how we put our lives into little boxes is very
true -- what does your comment about robertson have to do with that?

i was raised agnostic -- my father was never baptised and was raised
atheist.  he is not an atheist because he found a close-mindedness
present in the viewpoint of his parents equal to the close-mindedness
he found in the viewpoint of the christians he came in contact with.
thus i was _free_ to choose how to live my life, and he supported the
decision i made to join the episcopal church, although he emphasized
to me that his respect for my beliefs should result in my not
intruding on his beliefs, ie, i should not try to convert him, as that
is his decision.  (please, no flames or advice on how to convert him!)
one of my good friends is hindi and i greatly respect her
beliefs and the culture surrounding her religion.  my best friend is
jewish and i have always held a profound resepct for the jewish
religion (chaim potok and isaac bashevis singer are two of my favorite
authors).  i really do not think you can make that kind of
generalization about how christians choose -- and i do mean CHOOSE--
their faith.  if they have not consciously accepted the faith in their
adult lives (which is what confirmation represents), THEN you can talk
about their being brainwashed.

OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:

Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes
sense.  Matt 5:17 ""Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.""  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes.

Verse 18 says ""For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass
away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,
until all is accomplished.""  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, ""accomplished"" what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish.  

Verse 19:  ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,
and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.""  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.

In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about ""doing away with the Law.""  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your 
heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be ""doing 
away with the Law"" because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only 
God's Law.

In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.

In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way:

[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be 
justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus.

I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had 
served it's purpose, i.e. ""our tutor to lead us to Christ,"" and
now, ""we are no longer under a tutor.""  The law has been ""fulfilled"" 
as Christ said he would do.

God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same
personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the ""last
will and testament"" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
re-expressed in Christianity. 

On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the ""mysteries"" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism 
representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,
Acts 20:7)

OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives.

Please excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far...

   Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught, there is no punishment
 at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
 with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
 what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen
 any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching
 him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway.

   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,
 he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-
 gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment
 industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our
 modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that
 we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.

  And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much 
 about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is
 the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!
 And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to
 whatever violent hate-promoting ""music"" and videos they like because no
 one is home to stop it.

  This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn
 than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is
 shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in
 school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when
 they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There
 is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will
 bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is
 just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to
 whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again
I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears
for the second time:

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

Overall, this argument is an illustration of the ""etymological fallacy""
(see J.P. Louw: _Semantics of NT Greek_).  That is the idea that the true
meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact, our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
how it is _used_, not where it came from.  Very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between ""Easter"" and ""Ishtar.""  If Daniel
Seagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  But that is a highly
idiosyncratic ""meaning,"" and not one that needs much refutation.

You don't know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  Just about ANYBODY
with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A 
couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building 
submachineguns in the school shop.

I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of ""Smallarms of the 
World"".  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear
nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  
Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the
NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will
object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an ""Americanization""
of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and
whether it is ""American"" or not is irrelevant.

Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you would
have to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.
And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
the more meaningful contribution.

Homosexual Christians have indeed ""checked out"" these verses.  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.
Others simply do not address the issues.

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit-led course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know.  I suggest that
you stop ""proof-texting"" about things you know nothing about.

	Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll...
	First, since so many people gave me their 3 best, I decided to
give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. If you e-mailed
a response with only one, I gave it 3 pts. Please feel free to send me
your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before. 
	Also, votes are still welcome! Any mask you like will do, as I 
have received votes for players not in the NHL. Please mention what team
they play for, though.
	So here are the up-to-date results so far:

Even if they outlawed private posession of firearms, there would be no moral

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
 It also gives the amount of ""threats"" it is picking up, so if you go through
 the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
 number of ""threats"" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.

The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all.
But lets ignore that for the moment.

The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using
encryption?

Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as
Public Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption
process?

If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is
truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers
(depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who
cares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line
is insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from
sunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I don't trust it. This is the
attitude that everyone else should have. Instead of worrying about a
clipper chip, simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through, process, encrypt, and transmit over the
phone. The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse.

Can't work you say? No Standard you say? Obviously you have never
uses PGP.

Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is
kidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms.

One final thought addressed to EFF:
	1.Do you support the implementation of ANY form of
	encryption where the encryption key must be revealed?
	2.If you do, why? If not, why?
	3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either
	support or stop this proposal?
	4.If you do not support this proposal, what alternatives do
	you offer?

I want people to be able to get the things they need in life.  Property
ownership may not be ideal, but it is far better at letting people get
what they need to live a productive, fulfulling life.

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied,
caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the
Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a
common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the
first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all
property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops
went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford
privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry
D. Westbrook:  ""The change was immediately justified by the increased
industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.""

Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  ""The
experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried
sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the
vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of
later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into
a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser
than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much
confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been
to their benefit and comfort.""

Bradford did not blame this failure on the ""strangers"", but on the basic
selfishness in all men.  He wrote ""seeing all men have this corruption in
them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.""  In other
words, according to Westbrook, ""Bradford found private enterprise to be
the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.""

Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private
property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings
starvation, poverty and discontent.

	No chance.  If that CS ignited at all, it would have been
quite similar to a grain bin explosion.  Explosion, I note.  The
entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.  As
there was no explosion, there was no CS ignition causing the fire.

I don't want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd known
what I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
""nope"" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.
Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead.

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and
so would the people reading it.

Since the DC-X is to take off horizontal, why not land that way??
Why do the Martian Landing thing..  Or am I missing something.. Don't know to

That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in 
the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,
Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE""
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when
its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo
motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --
the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.

Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low
altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field
is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.

Sure nails can be cruel.  I'd imagine nails in your eyes would be

Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see
(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully
scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*
You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.
Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse, it seems to ""click"" along.  If this
doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly
recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off.

Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice
that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains
or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

Summary: Supposed ""Higher power output"".
Distribution: rec.motorcycles
Keywords: Using Splitfire plugs for performance.
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 54


Yo, Whaz up!!!

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,
I saw one think that someone said about ""Show me a team that used Split-
fires....""  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers.

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that
depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?
In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,
but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.
So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.

But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this
translate?  Increased torque should ""theoretically"" help twins make
more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made, just stick 'em in.

Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than
4's.        

As far as racing teams....  Ducati team ""Fast by Ferraci"" used
splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James
running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.
Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....

INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL

The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.

However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
National Security Agency.  The so-called ""Clipper Chip"" is an 80-bit,
split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would
store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be
classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products.

     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .

First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure
product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.
Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for
the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers
should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.

Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the
Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent, expert scrutiny.  

Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? 
Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth
Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few
of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer.

In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security.  However, the ""Clipper Chip"" solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins.

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:

ESCROW

The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom
hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.

Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to
the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be
asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration
have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the
Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,
but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no
back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,
Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto
cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the
algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be
made public.

The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,
secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private
firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for
about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers
for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al
Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press
briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any
private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?

COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY

The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,
and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export
controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony
Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential
Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement
in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is
reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,
a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon
as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.

Seems to me folks, that if you are so interested in acquiring CNN, just
buy your $1000 worth of stock today.  It's being traded everyday.  After you

I envision incorporation of new standart into
various communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & 
therefore cheap. The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from 
communication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip 
to the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the
form of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks 
will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.
Natural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the 
government databases - or else this new version of ""wiretap proposal"" 
make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular 
person, not on the particular modem or phone.
 
As a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about
ability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now 
anyway. Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, 
making it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when
interceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of 
state officials ?

According to what others have told me, the ST-296N is difficult to run at
the 1:1 interleave even though Seagate claims it.  I have a non-pc system
(don't ask what it is, you probably haven't heard of it) that is built

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS
	     
                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT

	     	  
	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you 
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll 
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the 
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government 
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the 
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going 
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian 
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What 
are the priorities, because there are several association of 
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to 
participate in setting up priorities for investment?  
	     
	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know 
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans 
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls 
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times 
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent 
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to 
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not 
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going 
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the 
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, 
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, 
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will 
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be 
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will 
be used to support the privatization of existing public 
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the 
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have 
some influence over the distribution of.  
	     
	     With regard to your second question, let me say that 
I would think that there would be people in both countries who 
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government 
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to 
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history 
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That 
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole 
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been 
unpopular.  
	     
	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is 
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that 
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments 
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in 
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them 
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies 
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it 
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the 
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and 
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce 
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on 
our side and on the Russian side.  
	     
	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an 
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the 
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the 
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next 
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for 
the taxpayers and workers of my country.  
	     
	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some 
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share 
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view 
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not 
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful 
investment.  
	     
	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But 
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than 
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier 
of the Cold War.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very 
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory 
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American 
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind 
of a very measured breakthrough.  
	     
	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory 
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief 
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you 
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to 
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification 
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how 
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager 
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions 
inherited from the Cold War?  
	     
	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of 
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with 
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent 
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States 
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing 
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of 
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude 
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that 
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for 
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out 
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed 
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and 
we agreed to continue to press that.
	     
	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to 
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the 
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the 
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, 
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to 
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States 
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join 
the NPT regime is critical.
	     
	     What was the second question?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and 
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the 
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, 
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other 
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on 
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies 
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of 
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the 
leadership of the Congress.
	     
	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be 
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there 
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to 
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there 
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed 
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be 
much less.
	     
	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing 
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my 
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement 
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to 
begin it in the fairly near future.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in 
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely 
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not 
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of 
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the 
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the 
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of 
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the 
last part of your speech?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to 
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say 
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a 
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the 
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been 
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music 
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists 
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know 
as much as I could about your history.  
	     
	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then 
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last 
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone 
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. 
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I 
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day 
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a 
personal feeling about Russia.  
	     
	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like 
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a 
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York 
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony 
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly 
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically 
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it 
occurred.  
	     
	     These are things that have always had a big impact 
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever 
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two 
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Gregg, I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is 
open to question.

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank -
what will someone bet me they weren't ""real"" Islamic owners and
operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors.

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down
the street?   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned 
and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them? 

So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all 
work out right next time.

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so many
pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.

I read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS
ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press,
ISBN:0-306-44331-7.

It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It
is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would
appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of
understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to
this particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to
understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in
microbiology or medicine. Table of contents:

Chapter 1

Chapter 2
	The Disease and the Cure:  The Microscopic World of Bacteria and
	Antibiotics
Chapter 3
	Reliance on Medicine and Self-Medication: The Seeds of Antibiotic

The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,
a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri
Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS
never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an
NHL record 9th OT loss this season.

Roster move:

Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill

Injuries:

Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.

Dominic Roussel

Game Summary:

I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts
I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by
a few things I did pick up:

First Period:
	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51
	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)
Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,
Har (interference) 18:43

Second Period:
	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00
	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09
	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38
Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har
major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,
Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50

Third Period:
	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)
	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11
	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38
Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30

Overtime:
	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.
Penalties - None

Power Play:
	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4

Goalies:
	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)
	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

Jim,

Please feel free to correct me and give me some texts.  As far as I can see the
only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in Mt. 23:15.
However since this is found only in Mt. it cannot be dated before 90CE which
makes it unusefull for understanding Second Temple Judaism.

  And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
activities.  It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
power and control are central to government. Since citizens can't be trusted to
run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their
own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>
start to hide things from the IRS, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and
that cannot be allowed!)

  Not very surprising to anyone who believes in ""hands off"" government. If
you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of
anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is
like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
chainsaw. The more centralized the economy is, the more potential
abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. If you think
credit companies are bad, ...  Well, I'm sure a democratic socialist society
would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- NOT!

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
""account""), but also for ""the behavior of their immediate community""?

First of all, how ""immediate"" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

Reply-To: lin@ray.met.fsu.edu

Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup 
several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, ""How to improve your
sight - simple daily drills in relaxation"", by Margaret D. Corbett, 
('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It 
talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been
any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by 
actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing 
the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the 
too-long eyeball?

Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most
logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,
i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been
any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by 
changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of 
eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the 
eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's 
idea, right?)

Thanks for any information.

They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.

I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service. They
are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple and
Norton Desktop for Windows. They have no clue at this time
and are collecting configuration information on the systems
which exhibit the problem. Anyone having problems loading the
Maple solver in MathCad 4.0 under NDW shoud call technical
support at 617-577-1017. They made no schedule promices,
but are actively working on the problem.

In the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configuration
selection in autoexec.bat to use PROGMAN (yuk, pew) whenever
you plan to use the Maple solver and NDW otherwise. I am using
Norton BE to place a little menu on the screen with a 5 second
timeout to auto boot NDW.

I'm about to undertake changing the fork seals on my '88 EX500.  My Clymer

57001-183  (T handle looking thing in illustration)
57001-1057 (Some type of adapter for the end of the T handle)
57001-1091 No illustration of this tool and the manual just refers to it

57001-1058 Oil seal and bearing remover.

How necessary are these tools?  Considering the dealers around here didn't
have the Clymer manual, fork seals, and a turn signal assembly in stock I
really doubt they have these tools in stock and I'd really like to get this
done this week.   Any help would be appreciated as always.

I recommend the book ""Adams _v_ Texas"", the story of a man (Adams) who
was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.  Most of the book
is the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays
caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts.

[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]

               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===

This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and
some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos
groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't
understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please
subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the
documentation provided there.

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

Ah, the verb ""to must"".   I was warned about that one back

So, why ""must"" they have such laws?

If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.
I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain
everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or
something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating
that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.
There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.
Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to ""go ballistic"",
but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been
reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for
PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.
I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the
domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.
For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help
quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.
Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to
ask the system, we hope.

I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  I can't use 3 chip simms in my

How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to
score?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it 
up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or
just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're
penalized again!
 
Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going
to, you have to do it for both teams.
 
Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and
then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of
games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line
can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --
he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should
be benched.
 
I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't
do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we 
need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay 
considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can 
easily do it again.
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins 
will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand
by that.
 
Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to
win 3! :-)
 
Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match
the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll
never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the
first one).

in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small

where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an
1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to
blow the horn.  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the
annual state-required safety inspection!
Not one of Ford's better ideas.

Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and
his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
forget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.

Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't
jinxed him.

Ok, god has the disclaimer, reserves the right to judge individual
cases.  If we believe him to be loving, then we also believe him to be
able to serve justice to all.  Don't worry if a Jew, or athiest is
going to heaven or hell, for that is god to judge (although truly
if you were concerned you could only worry abput those who refuse to
believe/satisfy gods decrees) as much as keeping yourself straight.
If you see something going on that is wrong, discuss it and explore it
before making summary judgement.  People have enough free will to choose
for themselves, so don't force choices on them, just inform them
of what they're choices are.  God will take care of the rest in his justice.

No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't
lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.

>...Even a simpleton knows that
>he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat...

Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim 
in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually
_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)
It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a
knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more
common. That's why it is important to look at the overall
(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of
substitution, different criminal techinques of using different
weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.

>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife
>than a gun, thanks.  

""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't
too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts
to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your
pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife.

>...Fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't
>another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have

>assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).

Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in
unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman 
without much problem.

You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime
Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a
knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,
using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)
a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless
of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective
than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""
nearly as often as they do guns.

Subject: Help with DTK I/O Plus II card needed
Reply-To: e.dierksen@att.com (Elliot Dierksen)
Organization: AT&T Tax Systems Development, Maitland FL
Lines: 36

I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK
I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation
is no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to
COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(

There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:
C1
C2
S2
P2
P1
G

The second bank is labeled ""IRQ"" and has the following labels:
5C
5S
4
3
3S
2C
2S

I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the ""G"" enables the game port and
the ""S2"" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I
have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that
this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t
know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules
of Islam in regard to banking. This is done explicitly by the
bank. This was not the case with BCCI.

This is crap. BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other
international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with
outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.

Back to childish propaganda again. You really ought to get a life
rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing. There are thousands
of Islamic banks operating throughout the world which no-one ever hears
about. If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about
all the people who've been robbed by American banks.

Everbody has been defining envelope.
Why was the world ""envelope"" chosen, rather than say ""shell"", 
or ""boundary"".  In analogy with the envelopes of airships perhaps?

Actually, ""shell"" might be good.  Push the shell too hard and
it (the aircraft?) breaks.

	Hmmm, let's see: I could upload some .BMP files (I have around 15
b/w and color ones), but I'd rather give you the fishing pole instead of the
fish:Here it goes:  
      Begginers guide to the coolest Windows backgrounds:
Step 1: ftp to cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu user:anonymous passwd: guest)
cd to pub/pc/win3/(util?desktop?) and get one of these : wingif14.zip,
pspro??.zip gws?????.zip . They will scale, dither and convert GIFs to BMPs.
get the index file from the win3 subdir too for future reference...
Step 2: ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu or plaza.aarnet.edu.au or archive.orst.edu
and cd to graphics/gif GET THE INDEX FILE... Now GigaBytes of pictures
are waiting to become your desktop... 
Advice: If you have a slow computer (<486DX w/4MB RAM), make your bg b/w
by selecting b/w dither in any of the abovementioned apps..
Hope it helps...

One addition to this... I don't know if it applies to everybody.  For my
(Microsoft 400dpi) mouse to work with windowed DOS apps, I had to use the
driver that came with Windows (Version 8.20).  8.1 didn't allow me to do
it for some reason.

      ?Huh? Okay, so I'm not Eric Molas, but even if that _is_ how he
feels about life, I disagree with it.

      Life, to me, is definitely NOT meaningless; it has precisely the
purpose and meaning I choose to give it. I go on living because I _like_
living; if I needed any further reason, I'd be free - completely free! -
to pick any reason that suited me. That freedom can be almost
intoxicating; it's probably the closest I've ever been to a 'religious'
experience. I'm *very* glad I am an atheist; I wouldn't be anything
else.

      Not unless, in explaining your own subjective experience, you also
try to convert him or proselytize. Merely explaining the effects you
personally experience religion as having on you, is not ""infectious"".
Not unless Eric is paranoid, that is. ;->

      Whatever floats your goat. You sound happy enough; that's fairly

      ""Empty spot""? ""God-shaped hole""? I hear such things a lot from
theists; never quite did understand what they were talking about.
I have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole'. Maybe some others do, I wouldn't
know; but I don't, and if I did, I'd seek help about it. Doesn't sound
like a mentally healthy situation at all, walking around with a 'hole'
in oneself.

      Well, not having written that original post, I don't know if it
was intended to be interpreted in such a way; but, having reread it
carefully, I somewhat doubt it. At least, that's not how he gets across
to _me_, your mileage may vary...

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

How about 250MB/s for 64-bit VLB or 350MB/s for QuickRing {Apple's

and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,
after all IS the bottom line. 

	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who
still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think
of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make
mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 

	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.

	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid
people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the 
built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 


	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do
not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,
the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and
unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.
	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box
has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree.

This isn't exactly audio, but take a look in ""RF Design"" magazine,

mentioned; in the same issue is an article that features a chipset

IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent
pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going
to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.

I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get 
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal'

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.
   Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind.

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the 
6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought
one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!

I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on

You're admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting that
your morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.

If you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ
X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.

This is quite different from saying ""Employing force on other people
is immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

For what it's worth - and yes, I know you claim to be an agnostic -
it's this ability to re-label things from ""immoral"" to ""moral"" 
that I find one of the *least* attractive qualities of the religious
mind.

Where does this ""Most Bible studying Christians think as Frank

Christians?

At least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as
wrong.  Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm
than good to your fellow Christians?

BTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist
church for a while.  I didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until I noticed a ""God's Science"" phamphlet
there.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about
""theories"" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I
began to notice a very similar style of ""answers"" for theological
questions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.

Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL.
Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a
few hassles with radial fills. Version 3 RevB
is better but if you try to export in SCODAL
with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like ""cannot export
SCODAL with bitmap""- at least it does on my
version.
 If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears.
 Temporal images make a product called Filmpak
which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript
to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650
and I was just wondering if there was anything out
there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad
cheaper.

Wrong...the major improvements for 2.01 and 2.01a are in the use of IPAS routines
for 3d studio.  They have increased in speed anywhere from 30-200% depending
on which ones you use.

All the Yost group IPAS routines that you can buy separate from the 3d studio
package require the use of 2.01 or 2.01a.  They are too slow with 2.00.

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting
on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the
heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. 

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived
here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast.

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system

I probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not
really intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine.
Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.

Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable
by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that
God exists. Simple.

I missed your ""Traditional Proofs"" treatise, but the proofs I remember
from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor
stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.

I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general
failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of.
(I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and
the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to
have funny names, anyway.)

>Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,
>I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen
>condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?

This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists.
Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.

>Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,
>the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the
>Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order

Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause
argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there
is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices
questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes
that the First Cause is God.

>I next assert that God is all good.

Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.

This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship,
then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is
human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating:
The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem
he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.

>Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim

Why?

Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?

If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?

:)

Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the
Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and
that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what
you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying,
as I have missed it.

>  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will
>reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,
>and thus must be followed blindly.

Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this
certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will
thus discover that we were wrong.

You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But
I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth.
How is it my assertion is less good than yours?

>  One may NOT deny the truth.

Oh?

I hereby deny 1+1=2.

I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.

Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that,
but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.

Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag
me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious
net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.

They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are
not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small
distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always
works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.

Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't,
we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more:
If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things
you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.

>Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may
not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows
that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must
be obeyed!

We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us.
But you have not connected denial with disobedience.

Hello Motif World,

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people
who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif++.

My question is:

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.

If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny, He writes:
""The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims""

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
"".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims""

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word ""ISLAM"" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, ""No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup"". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ??

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in
picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough
that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you
can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can
lock in on one and average the others out.

The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts
of interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also
highly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to
another,

I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views
should be endorsed or not.  All I was trying to find out was 
whether the newspaper article was correct in making these
statements about the President by obtaining some information
about when and where he made these statements.

Thank you.

I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds
attractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be
contaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in
scripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but
remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has
promised to give you light, so ask for it.

Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.

In the Air Force world at least, the crisis escalates when scale
models of the plane in question (i.e. about to be sacrificed) begin to
arrive in key Senators and Congresspersons' offices.

Of course it is assumed that coffee mugs and other decorative junk has

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,
I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main
file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions,
of course, in which case you're on your own!!!

Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time)
did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the
pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an
afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!

The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -
so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then
grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the
shape of the object being filled!!!

Of course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all
this and feel suitably :-)

Cheers, Toby.

No, do I have to?    I'm just commenting that it makes very

...continued from PART A:

The six of them left. They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-
ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the 
physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had 
an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas
ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this 
went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and 
was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into
tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .

Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I 
want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am 
silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling
me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the
one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, 
telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring 
her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned empty
handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his 
apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. 
There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.

They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I 
went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the
apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be 
cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the 
doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, 
opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle 
Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He 
knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. 
Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their 
apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying
delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.
All of my family had gathered there.
   
At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the
apartment.

Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda, 
Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes 
you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as though
her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one 
side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her 
cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole
microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was 
afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started 
to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the
bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye 
that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk, 
my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something
tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my 
little golden one . . . "" She understood me.

Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. 
She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't 
understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was 
glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her 
forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how 
to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's
saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil 
and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I 
can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me 
something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while,
then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says,
""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't
control myself.

Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped
a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She 
says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this 
damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need
to call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I 
understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich, 
that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him."" 
But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She 
says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She 
says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone.""

I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was 
crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can 
we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think, 
who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't 
answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and 
found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he 
was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, 
""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and 
tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was really
going on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's 
happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single 
Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised 
that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious 
. . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up 
and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK, 
fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back 
I'll send him over.""

We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly 
under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She 
wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed 
everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on
trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and 
finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your 
place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, 
because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep 
with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what 
shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has 
grown up daughters, they're almost my age.

The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and
went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, 
first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As
soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said
that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have
fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the
first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around
eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I 
saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies
. . . everything just like a war.

They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical
people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older 
Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud 
she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle 
Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he 
started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But 
when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his 
sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and 
started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""What
have they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and 
she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot."" 
Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what 
are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,
and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in 
there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my 
daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to 
drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the
doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa 
and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina 
out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I 
don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's 
the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter
in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.
I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told 
the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an 
Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my 
sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When 
she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would 
be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed
her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge 
wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said 
something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be 
dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.

They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. 
I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't 
know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" When
I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed 
very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says, 
""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They 
brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he 
just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said, 
""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were 
taking him.

Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were 
sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car 
up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't 
remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they
did to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa. 
Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I 
learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they 
didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying 
to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the 
balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw 
two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed 
against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him
with his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know 
what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before 
he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the
third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was 
Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they
were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with 
someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the 
yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that
I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.

They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too 
and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My 
father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault 
that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have 
probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not my
job."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, 
I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them 
to his apartment.

Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the 
doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I 
wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very
surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the
Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--
coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,
having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like 
they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.
""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she
would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same 
story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no 
drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon
found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And
they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at 
zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from 
seeing it.

They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have 
any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their 
place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira 
her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And
Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.
When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she 
involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.
Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful 
when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do what
you want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they 
wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I 
would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It 
was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do 
every day: steal, kill, rape . . .

Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts 
explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those 
children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the 
pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls that
would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow 
because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just
as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be 
of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the 
victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that
they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they
themselves said that.

And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many 
people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know 
why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, 
maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and 
they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at 
nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with 
Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over 
there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman 
shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . .

So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all 
happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several 
hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what
happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-
ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he
thought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What could
I do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words,
it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. 
That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of 
course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail
of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke
together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never
present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And
when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.

On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.
First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, 
the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. 
There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family 
there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They 
were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife 
and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.

Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.
There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.
They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.
The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide you
better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.""

We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We
had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to 
have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. 
They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you 
could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the 
police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is 
surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were 
standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought 
great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't 
just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,
or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost 
family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened 
when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single
person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must
have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret 
room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at
one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those 
people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that
the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the 
hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my 
parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should 
attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an 
Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and 
she wouldn't be able to take it.

Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people 
climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.
They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We 
calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some 
little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children
to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never 
have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people 
do eat.

Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They 
were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from 
the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a 
different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, 
and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came 
over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her 
sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were 
soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were
standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up
to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash 
him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not 
one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from 
doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, 
muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile
appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round
was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing 
terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the 
creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did 
this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She 
went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, 
""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they 
raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though 
nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no 
one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I 
could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so 
many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already
after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the 
elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. 
There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. 
The situation was deplorable.

At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, 
Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up
and put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, 
either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with 
dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little 
family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for 
the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone
spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded
machine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,
I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They hugged
them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly
moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.

They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in 
here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.""
This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other
places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the
SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I 
asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.
I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, the
Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest
assured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in
there is capable of anything.""

When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had
already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-
tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once
we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met 
acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who 
hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with 
them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had 
come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like 
they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, 
hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of 
course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed 
him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know 
what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.

And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very 
well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small 
room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night 
talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary 
of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see 
Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed 
from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask 
him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by 
soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with 
the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.

Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another 
two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, 
lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people 
who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I 
had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your 
Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are 
alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked 
them to continue what I was doing and went off.

The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's
father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels
Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the 
name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later 
it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had
somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for 
Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that 
in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored 
missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3

All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were 
contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple 
of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's 
going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels
they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev
[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to
him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it
was one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26
was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because
that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 
people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only 
a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try to
remember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there
were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy
don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people 
whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of
the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many 
people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns
in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the 
Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that 
there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical 
Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk 
cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went 
to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering
the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the 
Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's
more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list 
drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course
don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to 
publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, 
they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 
8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know 
her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in 
Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the 
same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her 
braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because 
they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one 
. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.

They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for
days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there 
and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; 
it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could 
already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the 
social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, 
""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gear
and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers 
and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, 
although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been 
dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it 
was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by
to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly
visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.

On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir
Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered 
only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.
Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.

Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I 
told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and
record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. 
We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the
conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor 
quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there 
weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a 
curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or 
video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that 
we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially 
to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw
that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to 
Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with 
Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two 
months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in
those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.""

He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I
gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to
her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-
self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-
rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat
and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we
were in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like 
this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're
not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this
investigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact I
was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-
ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement
cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in
every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of
Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary 
confinement.

Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma 
identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify 
anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the 
photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one 
who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the 
loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know 
his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that 
even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will 
continue looking for him.

The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various 
plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.
Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only
one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and
Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-
tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front
of me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash
simply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing in
a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the
investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even
though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological
pressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an
Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you
in short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.

The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire
pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was 
in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and 
all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned 
them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials
from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James 
Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were 
boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had 
been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't
even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did 
take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out 
slippers.

Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. 
Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for 
it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with 
one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that 
black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking
part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of 
Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently
arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I 
don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an 
Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know 
nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an 
axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and 
threw them into the tub with water.

I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You 
know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both 
their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-
eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I 
identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born
in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How 
did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I 
kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word 
as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one 
that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind
his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to
put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and 
told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said, 
""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an 
Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator 
asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one more
identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The 
name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became 
pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on the
table with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't 
turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start
acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they 
forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.
But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't 
me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his
hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew
into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out 
of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. 
Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked
and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and 
back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, 
but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or 
strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the 
microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his
last name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .
"" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. 
They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, 
because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're 
some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehand
they would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if 
nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or 
emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength 
. . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how were
you able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching
the tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped 
that high in gym class.""

So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of 
the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who 
beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.

At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his 
guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among
them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, 
""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three
o'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come 
we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went.

They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He
had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a 
motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him 
out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to get
the Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said, 
""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed 
him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was
in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that 
we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.

I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he
beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he
was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for
him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning
of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our 
apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I 
don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked
out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the
courtyard, he remained in the apartment.

At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her
I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't 
have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third
and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work
with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.

The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't
call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out
someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't 
understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know that
they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the
name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--
that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.
Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their
level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they
work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they 
crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were 
promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.
So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they 
promised us apartments.""

Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the
heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a 
children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at 
the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they 
have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or 
grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how
I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my 
own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time I
kept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife 
right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed.

But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a 
marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just 
have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his
grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how 
to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he 
knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed 
himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.

That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr 
Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilled
enough blood here.""

Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was 
that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya
and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They 
liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When 
Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors 
old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to 
the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were 
already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back
and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have 
sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older 
woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of 
Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.
The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands 
and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, 
he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.

There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first 
floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a
custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.
But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is 
tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.

Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we 
have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these 
events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come 
about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that 
without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not 
have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,
let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their 
nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are 
a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for
what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like
unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they 
threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,
to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on
February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone 
who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left
for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got
as far away as their legs would carry them.

February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came 
into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had 
been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for 
a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few 
teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or 
seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there 
were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the 
evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and 
the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the 
microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the 
driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani
child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had
seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They must
be killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The 
woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians 
cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That 
was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the 
direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.

We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a 
very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This 
he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him 
stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our 
territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my 
heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our 
territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. 
From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from
time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years 
the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant 
Armenians.

I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.
Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with 
the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,
that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our
teachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's 
spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we 
listened to the woman's speech.

Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the 
subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of
studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I
had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to 
obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,
""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If 
they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I 
tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he 
said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a 
second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already
after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, 
""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until 
twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in 
kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my 
children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go I
turned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the 
Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.

When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran
nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too 
much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed 
off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher 
wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.

To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at 
the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and
again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched 
television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last 
day. That's how it all was.

At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,
Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store 
on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she 
doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father 
held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the 
ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went 
out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the 
entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders 
there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the 
moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been 
injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, 
and their children: any way they could. 

Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, 
Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims 
what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one 
another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even 
with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and 
their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got 
them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked 
electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then 
they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an 
Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to 
escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of 
course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only
thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and
led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored 
personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that 
very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.

I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, 
strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a 
strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.

One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking 
for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, 
people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps 
dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and 
put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or 
infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the 
neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject 
came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the 
basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor
carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing 
as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor 
took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything 
seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing 
of ours he had managed to ""save.""

Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended 
themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were
Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some 
reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just 
victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. 
In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that 
the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not 
important, the truth will come out regardless.

So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our 
bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the 
years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've 
become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.

On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said
that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments
received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the 
Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-
tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on 
the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear
speaking our native tongue.

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue.  Simply amazing.

ATM will do nothing for your TrueType fonts.  If your TrueType fonts are
sufficient for your needs, don't run ATM.  I have a lot of fonts that I can
install either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.  I have
noticed that:

    1.	TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1
	equivalents.  If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware
	that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not
	(they are encrypted).

    2.	With a 300 dpi laser printer, the ""artificial bold"" version of a
	TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to
	install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want
	to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually
	distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the
	artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior
	to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient
	for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50%
	on disk space (uncompressed).

Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse
engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from
experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were
all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.
Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)

So on this point at least there's not so much worry.

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure, methinks.

The flushing is due to vascular dilation, part of a migraine attack.
Some people event get puffy and swollen.  As long as you are careful
you can see well enough to avoid getting hit in the face or eye by
the ball, migraine will not hurt your health.

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain 
things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any 
pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.

Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where
knowledge of sacred things is withheld:

1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed
Peter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no 
man, until the Son of man be risen again from 
the dead"" (Matt. 17:9).  
If we were living at the time of Savior, there
would be no (public) record of this event.

2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision 
of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words, 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter""
(2 Cor. 12:4).
This person heard something which Paul can not 
write to the Corinthians (and us).

3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of
Mormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were 
""forbidden that there should not any man write
them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows
for those of you without access to the BOM).

3 Nephi 26:16
Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the 
multitude gathered themselves together, and they
both saw and heard these children; yea, even 
babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous
things; and the things which they did utter were
forbidden that there should not any man write them.

Some LDS scholars speculate that these words
which could not be written are the sacred
portions from temple we are to withhold from 
the world (but it could be something else).

>I
>can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful
>Mormons, but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple
>ritual in mystery.  

There is much we can discuss about the temple 
ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms
and other vicarious ordinances for the dead.
We can discuss certain concepts regarding the
endowment (""the ritual"").
However, there are certain elements I can not
discuss with anyone (including other saints)
outside of the temple.
As a portion of the endowment, we receive the
tokens and signs that will permit us access
to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred 
and respect the conditions under which it is
revealed to me.

Yes, victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and
more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims,
including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government
is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away
from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.

Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany
either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did
not have an army or a government.

I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a
colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an
area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis
in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks,
it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.

It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in
Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they
should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.

I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military
intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed
to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was
not nearly as risky.

Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good
for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not ""everyone"" wants to help the
side that is less like us.

I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is
innocent.

There are just too many good reasons to stay away:

1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders
   in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the
   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to
   promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible
   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.

2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full
   stop.

3) It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish, nor that it
   would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and
   at what point any commitment could be ended.

Since our doctors are private and the ""system"" is just an insurance
plan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise,
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.

A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash.
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies.

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since

People of influence will get their way in any system, American or
European.  It's the ""Golden Rule"" - he who has the gold makes the
rules. (-;

As for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities
(e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive
for-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services.

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total

the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)
disappears, as they were there before it appeared.

For one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are
a player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the
health insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but
health insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being 
spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;

OHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind
of health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.

Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down
here.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them-
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who ""deserve it"".

I agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems
that they have won bigger, when you look at how full their coffers
are.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out
for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON,
(Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense
privileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.

And who's advocating that?  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center, I can only be charged with
more than one murder, and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage?  After all, the bomb was a single act.

The service notice on the 13"" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement  
of the hi-voltage capacitor). All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie. It was in force for a year. If you got it free after  
3/23, you got a deal...

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday, July 6.

12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists""  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the ""central dogma"" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology.

12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists""  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry.

3:00-5:45pm ""Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis"" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain.

3:00-5:45pm ""Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming"" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field.

3:00-5:45pm ""Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis"" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses.

I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My
roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks
for explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was
when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and
music. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other
then that, hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah
right! Baseball seasons started (Zzzzzz.....) =)

Barnstaple, England/Reuter

	A motorcyclist said to have drunk away a $290,000 insurance payment in
less than 10 years was banned Wednesday from every pub in England and Wales.

	David Roberts, 29, had been awarded the cash in compensation for
losing a leg in a motorcycle accident. He spent virtually all of it on cider, a
court in Barnstaple in southwest England was told.

	Judge Malcolm Coterill banned Roberts from all bars in England and
Wales for 12 months and put on two years' probation after he started a brawl in
a pub.

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,
or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.
Now I just try to get them off my tail.

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch
into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than
from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,
I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,
(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  

If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps 
(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get
my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  

A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for
me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,
yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a
cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. 

On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing
illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is
custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a
plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  
John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

 Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably 
consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does
not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by
latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for
about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at
most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before
there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...
mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just
fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what
brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then
how could it exist before humans?

 Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about
biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There
is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'
in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a
collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the
degeneration of the genetic code'.

 Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But
it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as
much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even
when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',
(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and
died off for lack of nearby hosts.
 I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few
hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to
be getting less nasty w/age...

 Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?
And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It
seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less
lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,
imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us
by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning
ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made
our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases?

 Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the
phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'
system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system
that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a
perfect system. At least, IMHO.
 Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the
original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?
If so, why could God not have used better materials?
 Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,
of did It just choose not to?

>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.

 My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for
the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't
help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->

	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong.  
	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here.  
comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.
Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games?
score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause.

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?

    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
  ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  
Later in the same post:
     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

I wrote:
  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been

Awesley relied:
     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

I wrote:

Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has
taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half
decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said ""yes, I
shelled Americans,"" or ""I gave the orders to fire the cannons,"" or ""I

Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. 
Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?

Awesley concludes:
     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read

Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism,
I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous
philosophy.

I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish
scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if
they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism,
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi, who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO. His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of Judeo-Nazism.

Yes, I remember that now.  Well, in that case, the cones are indeed

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a 
clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The
Get Date call notices that a ""midnight reset"" flag has been set, and then
then advances the date.

Anybody with more info?

I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to 
the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we 
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, 
we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we 
encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
Christianity and reject what isn't.    

We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine 
the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch 
and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  
Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy-
headed drifting from idea to idea.

One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme 
in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions 
recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It 
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for 
pointing out the parallel.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, 
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct organization.

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.

Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.  

I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have ""a positive view"" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a ""positive
view"" of themselves?

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of ""society"", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications
BESIDES I.C.C.M.?

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,
Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,
if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other.

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X
one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.

Thanks in advance

Please, PAY ATTENTION.
I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed,
(regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a
higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun,
then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point,
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the
weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

Subject: How Do I Modify Key Map?

Hello folks,

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:

mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm. It looks like the following:

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned
functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm.

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
implement, not time to learn how to implement.

You are obliged to let the police search the equipment if they have a
proper court order. You are under no legal obligation to keep the data
intelligble. If you wish to run your BBS entirely with all data

well, thats their problem. There are no legal restrictions on domestic

Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1).

I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a 
personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have 
with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for
others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just 
Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems
within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters
of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by
objective means.  

Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these 
matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this
that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing
the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.
Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is
universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud
notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that
leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)

[It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own
ability to know the truth.  There are also different paths in some
areas of practice.  But I'd like to see more clarification about what
you mean when you reject the idea of saying ""their specific beliefs
are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on
others.""  If something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming that
the belief is something about God, history, etc.  Of course something
of the form ""I believe that it's best for me not to xxx"" could be true
for some people and not others.  I have suggested in the past that God
may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are.
But that doesn't mean I doubt that there is a difference between
true and false, nor that I think there is no benefit in finding out
what is true.  --clh]

Since the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed 
internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign 
governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic 
citizens, this is a world-wide issue.  Thus Distribution: world.

Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip?  Do we give a shit
about anybody's privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our
own; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to
somebody who has a wiretap on their phone?

I find the ""call thru your computer"" ideas may reflect this attitude.
Ideas that are of, by, and for hackers, and don't help anybody in the
real world, aren't going to do anybody much good, including ourselves
where voice phones are concerned.

We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but
we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  

What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time 
voice-encryption RSA, silicon compile it and spit out ASIC.  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans 
it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,
Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the 
NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity.

Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of 
red herrings and smoke screens.

Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today
through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont
was kind enough to send me):

	Taking action? A white geese be held
	as an accomplice to be held as
	a decision upon the door
	A black and white goose waddles past

	White goose waddles past the 
	confidence interval for the population 
	of geese be axed, 
	fine.
	And white goose 
	waddles past the door.

Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more
coherent?  Less coherent?

Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem
about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being
held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize
an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be
black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the ""getaway car""
tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our
being is not to ""get away"" from responsibility for our actions,
but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the
""driver"" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition
of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal
conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?

Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and
a random number generator?

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,
they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it.

If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do
not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because
some parts of its design were kept secret.

So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal
activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.

In short, the new technology can:

1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.

It cannot:

1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations.

2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who
handle them, etc.

3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication.

I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5"" MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14"" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the
Administration will have made it ""very clear"" to the vendors that ""it
would very much be in their best interests"" to institute a ""voluntary""
policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment
to anyone other than ""Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement"",
or individuals and corporations who ""have been been determined by the
Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis"" for an
effective system.

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control
bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting.
The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed
to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology
in question are different.

I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling
the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need ... ""we know best..."".  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.

>
>Hal Finney

Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with
(you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely
ominous trend.  So what if ""1984"" will be ten years late... it still is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of
people wake up, and in a hurry.

One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we
now be saying 'subject' instead?)...  Why SHOULDN'T the average person
have a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why SHOULDN'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would
take some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to
have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I don't really see a
difference, philosophically.  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate, not
with such high-tech tools as a TAPE RECORDER...

How does Chicago differ from the (sort of) announced Windows 4. My understand-

of NT Lite--a full-fledged operating system but lacking server and security
features that make NT such a bear. Is W4 not true multithreading?

C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April 
1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A 
number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg
    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.


The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.

No flames here.  All your points are well taken.  Guess I still have a

ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - 
the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but 
there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it 
takes a while).

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,
why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when
you ""need"" it.

Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least
SOME of this helped.

In fairness, we should note that if you look up ""speculum"" in the
dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first
definition is ""a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments.""

Which doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far
off as you might think.

Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and
re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless
cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

What will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded
goods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's
favor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-
check your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling
VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?

Indeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,
but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes
which are the units of genetics.

We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful
memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will
run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that
future technology has to offer.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions
against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at
CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid
Mary.

We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people
with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people
with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic
fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things.

Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe
that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would
not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent
the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.
And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that 
would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank
goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me.  

I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you
would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
opinion, and then move on with your life.
Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in 
this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.
These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going
to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was 
helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very
unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.

A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what
I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are
only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because 
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it.


I have chosen the latter.

Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.
The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in 
their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and 
independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and 
fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

the architect of the Genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, the most

Republic in Berlin during World War II; 

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 20,000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht.

Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at
republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and
political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a
Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain
rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the
majority.

This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not
immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.
Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does
prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.  
As far as ""enough active voters"" are concerned, that is still
an open question until the vote is made.

You portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you
silence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is
allowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be
restricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.

Are you arguing that the Lyme lab test is accurate?
The books that I've read say that in general the tests
have a 50-50 chance of being correct.  (The tests
result in a large number of both false positives and
false negatives.  I am in the latter case.)

We could get those same odds by ""rolling the dice"".

This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..

I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them
that then drys and makes hard walls...

Why not do the same thing for a space station..

Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons,
spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden?
and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..

Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)

Sorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today.. (grin)..

Why musta  space station be so difficult?? why must we have girders? why be
confined to earth based ideas, lets think new ideas, after all space is not
earth, why be limited by earth based ideas??

Subject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation
Lines: 154
Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(
toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got 
into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 
supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams 
per day).

	1. Review Article ""Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C"" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.
	   5(3):110-129(1985).

But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both 
glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.

	2. ""Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones"" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)
	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.

	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria"" Clin. Sci. 38
	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.

For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is 
required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is 
quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% 
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the 
extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 
Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg 
per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was 
increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose 
and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average 
before supplementation.

B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about 
yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your 
intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate 
kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309
-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion.

	Here are the high oxalate foods:

	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.
	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams

	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, 
	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.
	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.

If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't 
have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for 
males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more 
per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  

The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day 
for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 
requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that 
either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 
excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,
isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B6 supplements.

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is 
calcium-oxalate.

	4. ""The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of 
patients with calcium oxalate calculi""Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)

	5. ""Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the 
crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium 
interaction""J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).

	6.Review Article, ""Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment 
of renal calcium stones"" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the 
medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone 
formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in 
stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier 
post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I 
guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney 
stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought 
I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to

Maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on

I *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and
having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser
degree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after
having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not
purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.
Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the
responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)

It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the
objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic
authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way
of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of
Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter
night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that
I was not ""brain-washed"".

We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms.  In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  It supports a rich API to a high
level IPC mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven
application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, Open Look,
Motif, MS-Windows and Mac (at the flip of a switch).

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore,
any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the ""average citizen"" cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.

There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA
encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am
aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.

FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM.
Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as ""mucho bucks"" or ""incredibly reasonable.""  Either way, however, this
definitely falls into the ""routines *they* tell you to (use)"".

FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents.

In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.

Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the
other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is
merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if
such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.

I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
and coffee).

And/or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse (should be directions
in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse) and cleaning it with
alcohol (isopropyl, I believe - the same alcohol as used for cleaning
your cassette deck).  This is good to do every so often, even if you
have a mouse pad.  Dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the
rubber ball.  As well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto
the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and
vertical sensors.

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS.

NAME: COMP.DATABASES.ACCESS

MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been
assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.

PURPOSE: 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic.
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases.

RATIONALE:
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price.
Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices.
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.

Sometimes.  It depends on your monitor and your timing.  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control.  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. 
With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock
solid.

Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is

simultaneously.  I'm not a user of one of these, but I have installed
a couple for people at work (I'm a technician).  Hope this helps.

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.

I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said ""a nice Alpine"" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher
in quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside before
you scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.
Maybe even the same thing I found.

Good luck!

Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 
I am new to Xlib



replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when
powered by 5 volts) and a maximum current and a Maximum Static
Voltage Across Switch.  Not a good bet for TTL.  Should work for
CMOS, but slow things down a bit.  There are 74HC versions that
have better specs. but lower max voltage.

My online Bible is on a CD, but I don't own a CD-ROM system for the
time being, so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didn't want to break existing (Jewish) laws. In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.

- Do they mean that all ""COSE-complient"" apps will use the Motif

- Do they mean both of the above?

- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
  (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)

What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics,
emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the
first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
forgot to call all of your witnesses.

If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find
such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser
could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser
becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new
expert witnesses).

As unfair as it may seem, the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is
that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars. Toyota can
afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image.

After all, door seal failing on a 6-year old Stanza is not comparable to

   I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial
and repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with
its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the
loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional
protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the
civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such
as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.
   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the
form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. 
Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more
crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,
it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate
amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their
numbers in population.
   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer
in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. Unless people
account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate
community, nothing will improve.

Regards, 

Neal

The Chicago Tribune pitching form has Perez pitching today (4/16).  But
given the way that Buck changes his rotation so often, that could just be
the work of a confused stat-page editor.

Of course its possible, I get 1024x768 on my Centris 650. All you need is
a correctly wired video cable.

The same thing Scotsmen where under there kilt.

I'll never forget the day when I was about tweleve and accidently

Kind of changed my opinion a bit.  They didn't seem so menacing after

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 
23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request ""5a"", ""5b"", ""5c"" and 
""5d"" separately
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]
	3) fix 8 is in two parts: ""8a"" and ""8b""
	4) fix 13 is in three parts: ""13a"", ""13b"", and ""13c""
	5) fix 16 is in two parts: ""16a"" and ""16b""
	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which 
previously was optional
	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for ""PEXlib.uu.[1234]"".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, ""22a"" through ""22i""

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail 
it a request, and it mails back the response.
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can 
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). 
The xstuff server treats the ""Subject:"" header line just like any other line 
of the message.
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an 
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command ""help"" or ""send help"" causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""index"", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. 
For example, you can say ""send index fixes"" (or ""index fixes""). A message that 
requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""send"", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name 
an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out 
shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If 
your mailer deals in ""!"" notation, try sending to 
{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  61)  Where can I get OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. 
	Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at 
1.1.5.
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.
	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.
	ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	SILOGIC (+33 61.57.95.95) ships Motif 1.2 and Motif 1.1 on Sun 
machines.
	S.I. Systems offers Motif 1.2 for Solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
USA and Canada.
	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333, UniVision (UK) Ltd. (44) 628 82 22 81) ships an 
implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library 
implementation of libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.  Motif 1.1.2 is 
also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced 
Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the ""vanilla"" X11R4 Intrinsics, where ""vanilla"" means ""with just a few 
patches""; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are 
some known new geometry-management problems.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

	Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape;
the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.
	XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i (""roadrunner"") are available for 
ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70), directory pub/X11R4_386i.
	Supported binaries of XView 2.0 or 3.0 include: 

XView for non-Sun Platforms  (domestic and selected international vendors).
Several are also available from Sun; contact your local sales office.

Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications)

	The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.

	A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now 
available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93):
        DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1
        MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1

	HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5
sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on
export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check 
that group for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed
software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or 
earlier versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also
directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in
contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area,
provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).

	These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular 
use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: 
sirius.ua.oz.

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ 
and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for 
instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file ""/usrX/ls-lR.Z"".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file ""/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX"".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.

In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and 
provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4"" tapes.  It 
also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received
user key and mouse input. 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  
	At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). 
	The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. 
	The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) 
includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for 
use. 
	The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  75)  Where can I get an ""X terminal"" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh
exec >/dev/console 2>&1
/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0
case $? in
 	0)	;;
 	4)	/etc/reboot -q -n
 		;;

  Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance

  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you
converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something).

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. 

>Gary's list of ""I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that.""

  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean
Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. 

>That's all for now.  I'm looking at Derrick May's tapes tonight, along

  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month.

Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the
joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"".
This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated
or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.
This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time
will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.
That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press
portrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of those
people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the 
gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the
2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk 
voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.
  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the 
official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to
public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.
So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their
advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they
were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification
what so ever of doing what they did.
   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,
may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.

Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton
leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's
(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be
unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).
And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved
in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to 
find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.
It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).

Other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends

e.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively

Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm
when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people don't react to candida,
we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not
react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida.
If not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.

You've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.
Find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying
it is the cause of whatever.  Since no one can disprove it, you can
rake in the bucks for quite some time.

That is odd, isn't it?  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these

I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....


Overall Crime rate:
It fell....just like that...

Acquiring weapons in Norway:
You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a 
permit, and a good reason to get the permit....
If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from 
the police and to be a member of a gun-club.
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
records of SERIOUS mental diseases.
Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun
-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'
for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short 
time befor the crime.

Use of knives:
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.
You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open
in public -rigth ??

Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':
We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide
to take action we DO.
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....
(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

Individual vs masses:
Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
extent....
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others ??


The issue:
I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.
We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
But should it have to be like that ??
Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??
If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns ??

Disclaim-her:
I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. 
I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as
neccities or toys.
I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't
want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if
anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz).

Why all the quote marks, Roy?  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, 
or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that ""child abuse"",

So Armenians are justified in aggression since supposedly Turks have
been aggressive in the past?  I don't follow your logic.

I have said that I don't wish to get into Cyprus discussion and did not
give any reasons for Turkey's involvement.  I also am not trying to

INteresting question about Galileo.

Galileo's HGA  is stuck.   

The HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.

If the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would
cook the foci elements.

question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?

After all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?

or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing
and seek might have caused an HGA sun point?

This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.

3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
pitching.

>One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the

I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,
Gordon).

  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.

According to WNCI 97.9 FM radio this morning, Dayton, Ohio is operating a
gun ""buy back"".  They are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in.
They ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of
some sort.  They are looking for more funds to keep operating.  Another

Is there something similar pro-gun people can do ?  For example, pay $100

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

    I just moved from Borland C++ 3.0 to Visual C++ today. When I tried
to compile my C++ program, it complained a function prototype problem.
It turned out that the typedef WORD in MS C++ is a BYTE, not unsigned int.

    Could anyone shine some light on this subject ? Why a WORD is a BYTE ?

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""

  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from
NSA.)

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is really scary.  Since the ""expectation"" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security.

""return_place"" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an
integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,
and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when
you're done.

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly
classify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love
one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.
The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

In rec.autos you write:

>if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
>it can't be half bad..  :-)

This McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto,
but You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo,
or whatever auto transmission. It's a normal manual transmission
gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do
the shifting. 

That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out 
minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions 
(Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift,
either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage
with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.

As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 
'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an
advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the
loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But
then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.

There's no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to
point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so there's
no need for a flame war.

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is
a non-seqitur.

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,
jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,
skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire
the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.
Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely.

I will add my voice to the (hopefully) growing multitudes.

I hereby pledge $1000.00 towards the purchase of CNN, under the same conditions
as already described.  I will also post this idea on the other nets I can 
access (RIME and Libernet).

We may have to organize this ourselves, so I am looking for help.

       I'm neither a doctor nor a firearms tech expert, but it would seem
that given the way a holstered gun points, accidental injuries inflicted
that way would be among the least lethal.

...His account that is.

Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here
on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is
one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The 
out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
don't like what he says or thinks.

We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have
not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)
in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.
If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,
unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that
Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif
net police, Ted Frank.


PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE. 

                      ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?  
                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?  
                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?
         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?

I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!

 
Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that 
you may understand this vial act for what it is...

------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------

Newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal
Subject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666
Summary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!
Expires: 
Distribution: 
Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder
Keywords: NWO Ted Frank

Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and
thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.
I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his
defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed
at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding
via netmail...)

While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him
axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. ""Argumentum
ad silence-your-opponent-um""?! I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).

The issue that seems to be: ""Is the following an advertisement?""
Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...

1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 
	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post
	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of ""Newsweek"",
	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.
2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	""proof"" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and
	behold, ""poof"", there goes my account. This one had an
	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get
""Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..."" or whatever; they
only get ""I don't like what that user is doing because..."".
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying ""Thanks for
the info"" or ""Could you send me such and such?"" or ""Your posts are
very interesting... keep it up."" and only a handfull of ""Go aways"". But,
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...""My name is Ted and
and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them..."")
NWO Indeed!

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.
I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post
to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. 
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.
Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I
was just getting started.

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of ""interest"" to the government, and Ted sure seems
to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does
he work for? The University of Chicago which he ""attends""(?) is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...

And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I
am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY
soon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:

yes i agree. BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here

we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape (which i assume this is ment to be).
we (CS operations) don't like to get involved in this stuff (unless
its illegal, repetitive posts of 1gig gifs, harassment, or something
else that offends the community in general). my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look

Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in
several FAQs but couldn't really find anything.

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want
(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.
I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
the best (performance wise) and most economical way
to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual
hasn't been very helpful with this.

Thanks.

Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language

with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable

under Windows, but appear as ""funny"" characters on the workstation.  The
workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem
entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. 
On further investigation I found that the character codes used by
Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the
MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the
workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it.
Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days

The biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the
availability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000
and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,
British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There
are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here
it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? He's from
California."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,
a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio
play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were
the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was
on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational
hockey for about 35 years.

Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for
the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,
cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club
dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues
cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.

By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""
areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an
industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther
King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west
of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.
Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive
to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them
give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee.

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""

So, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other

Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but they
don't.  Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.
When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. 

Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.

Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read
open.

I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?

Well, I saw a few posts on this and asumed that everyone is talking about 
the new 14"" display... mine does it to... kinda like when I would degauss 
my old 13"", and since the new one lacks this button, I assume that is 
what it is doing... anyone that knows I'd appreciate the info, but it

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points.
+/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull,
John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.

Given the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can
inflate his totals.

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).
It is a 3.5"" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the 
drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the 
differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one.

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).

Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If ""Clipper"" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.

I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it 
from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the ""voice scramblers"" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.

I disagree.  Modulo ITAR, it's not the government that has sabotaged the

[...stuff deleted...]

Computers are an excellent example...of evolution without ""a"" creator.
We did not ""create"" computers.  We did not create the sand that goes
into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into
processor board.  We took these things and put them together in an
interesting way. Just like plants ""create"" oxygen using light through 
photosynthesis.  It's a much bigger leap to talk about something that
created ""everything"" from nothing.  I find it unfathomable to resort
to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists: we
simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings -- if there even
were beginnings at all.  And that's ok with me.  The present keeps me
perfectly busy.

I'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.

*******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Boy am i glad you decided to read this. I've got a problem that 
I need as many people's help from as possible.

Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell
you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy
meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...

OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family
and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the
street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...
her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have
been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about
2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. 

By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.

OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming
back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I
drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent
the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though
we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being
in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.
(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could
ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to 
mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but
she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family
is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the
extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she
knows I am a Christian. 

Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such
a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid
you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.

In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding
dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).
She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended
up leaving school....Now we are at the present...

Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....


""Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not
going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College
just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and
that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested
me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was
interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with 
kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents
could tell.

""So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now
I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room
M-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and 
it's great experience.

""As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very
near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to
study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of
years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be
to Kansas.

""Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district 
manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for
about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll 
basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to 
chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either
one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it
be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??
What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.

""This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay
and any thye of management experience would look good on an application
or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good
benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time
service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng
for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up 
paying out of state tuition wherever I go.

""Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I 
respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for 
soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really 
good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want
to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.
I don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female
is too bad. 

""Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,
MARRY ME...

""You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously
(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the
home life later.""

***********

OK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you
think she meant about the marraige thing?? 

I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her
letter!!! I don't know what to think??

Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a 
Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???

I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and
get married....but what does she mean??? 

I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that 
I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that
most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the
Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here
she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!

Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am
so attracted to paying some real attention to me.

I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm
only 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through
classes..

I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..
saying, ""God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..""

Could this be my sign???

I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes 
it worse..

Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like
to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.

I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very
average guy like me??

I'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.

Thanx 

Chris

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not 
run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true 
multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 
programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is
primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users.
	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  
It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's 
just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed 
on CD-ROM.

Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, 
and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the 
main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense 
competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will 
arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the 
client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  
(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't
scorn the concept.)
	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be 
released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '96.
	With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)

Well, Napoleon. It is your kind of people who are preventing peace 
on the world. First of all, you didn't answer the question I asked
at the end of my posting. And then you told me some bullshit
throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue,
filled with hatred, and filled with emotions. Why am I doing this?
Forget it, I don't think you are worth it to discuss the issue.

A relative of mine has recently been diagnosed with ""stage 3 papillary cell
ovarian cancer"".  We are urgently seeking the best place in the country for
treatment for this.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

As you might suspect, time is of the essence.

Thanks for your help.                                      Bob

Subject: Need help identifying Serial board
Organization: Strategic Software, Redford, Michigan
Lines: 26

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
	     
The only identification printed on the board is ""MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD""
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words ""SERIAL NO"", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers ""1990 2 8"".

Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond
Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home
last year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the
""Diamond"" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.
If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.  

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too many
expectations I guess.

I've just installed a 5.25"" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like ""1"".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25"" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25"" device.  The service techs I talked to said, ""Oh sure,
we stock those.""  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25"" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25"" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25"" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

It must be... ...I type it with my left hand.  Personally, I would have
a real problem with my keyboard opened up like that, because I tend to
share some keys with both hands, particularly if I'm doing something else
with one hand (like using the cursor keys, mouse, or glass of Jolt).

***** Windows 3.1 enhanced mode:

     The Windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542.  However, just in case
something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed
that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when
you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".


* MSDOS configuration:

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,
you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive
(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs
much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section
called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system
up.


* Windows configuration:

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the
""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you
might want to try adding some more lines:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off
	SystemROMBreakPoint=false
	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF

(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The
""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).


* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:

     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your
	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution.

     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen ....

If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the
Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808
(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use
Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really
slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other
solutions.

     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you
do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.
What you can do is one of the following:

     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
	Smartdrive.

     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for
	""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported
	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
	the 1542) to work with Windows.

     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following
solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I
am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused
by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following
does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:

1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI
   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two
   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your
   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
   still there).

2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS
	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high
   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.

   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason
   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without
   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider
   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.

3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer
   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only
   three ways to get a copy:

      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other
	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is
	around $75.

      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around $30.

      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.

Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing
this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem.


***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250:

1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive
   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.

2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542.)


* Tape backups/restores take a long time:

     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best
results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary.

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,
rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is
""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can
be done in one of two ways:

* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use
  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:

	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4

  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".

* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The
  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running
  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults.

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I
  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.

Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4
microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores
should run faster.

     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what
you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh.

     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),
this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried
running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I
was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?


* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:

     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my
system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the
tape head:

1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,
   resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.

3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a
   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.

4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other
   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.

5. Too many tape read errors.

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I
upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


***** Sound cards:

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the
tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is
that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).

     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may
not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


***** Miscellaneous info:

     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not
verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm
not sure.  Use it at your own risk.

* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""
  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.
  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.

* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.

* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
  information):

     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for
	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact
	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need.

     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM
	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know
	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around
	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.

     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410
	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in
	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
	boards.

* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are
  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
  following is secondhand information):

     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.

     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS.

* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.
     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.
     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and
	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:

     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI
	drivers).

* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you
  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know
  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,
  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:

	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10
	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might
  have it, if any forum does.

* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.
  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).

* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked
  like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I
  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first
  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version
  doesn't.

As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000
series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support
sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running ""unix applications"".
You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read 
that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Hope
this helps.

I disagree with your claim that Jews were not evangelistic (except in
the narrow sense of the word).  Jewish proselytism was widespread.
There are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism, both in the New
Testament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day.

I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly isn't
anything magic about it.  The components used are decent, but
nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.

The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom had
the guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I see
audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they
are supposed to serve.

I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as
low-technology as a GFA-555.

I'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years.
Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to
go wrong.

If so, I am having trouble concatenating string variables together and

say fullpath			// output = 'th/'

Perhaps so. I was only responding to the ""Yankees of the 20's and 30's"" 
part of the comment. If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost,

Privacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting
out ability to prosecute criminals.  We are supposed to have the
presumption of innocence.

I have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my
door, and the police may not come in.  If I perform a crim in my home,
they will have to find out by means other than simply looking.

Encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home.
Simple enough?

And yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie

I seriously doubt that the NSA thinks that privacy and surveillance are
compatible.  I doubt of any smart person in any other agency thinks
so, either.  The PROBLEM is that they simply hold PRIVACY to be of no
value at all.

      It strikes me, for no apparent reason, that this is reversible.
I.e., if I had proof that there existed a hell, in which I would be
eternally punished for not believing in life, would that make me a Xian?
(pardon my language) _Bloody_hell_no_!

Hmm, you still don't get it. Then again, I'm not posting from a  University

And still -- Libertarians want the State out of their lives. Parents are very

You may want to inquire about taking Lupron as a medication. It's

Lupron is taken as a monthly injection, whereas other drugs such

I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an

I am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable
in this case.

More interesting only for your propaganda purposes. I have said several
times now that I don't consider Iran particularly exemplary as a good
Islamic state. We might talk about the rights of people in ""capitalist
secular"" third world countries to give other examples of the lack of
rights in third world countries broadly. Say, for example, Central
American secular capitalist countries whose govt's the US supports
but who Amnesty International has pointed out are human rights vacua.

Hi all,

I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or
two without access to really important information.  I saw the 3.5 million
shoulder back on the DL--How long is he out for (i.e. How many millions/inning
will he get this year?)  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, just
wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current
big producers go over a relative pittance. (Please realize the term 
""relative pittance"" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball
salaries.)

Additional questions:  I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this spring--how is
he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?

How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third?

Are they going to build a new stadium?  When?

YESSS!  You make me proud to
be an 'Merkun.  Good thing you
didn't get shot though. Don't
try that with a good'ole boy in Texas.
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was 
in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, ""Stick that
finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorry-ass throat.""  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred
cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, 
waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided 
not to shoot me.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all
the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has
that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a

HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these.  I don't remember which
suburb they are in.  The prices are pretty reasonable and they are
easy to hook up.  I bought a new coin mechanism from them for $25.00

my understanding was that ted turner (owner of the braves) started running
his tv station nationwide, and started running all of his team's games on
his nationwide tv station, he dubbed his team ''america's team'' - that is,
the only team (at least, at the time) all of whose games could be seen

now, wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus, but not all mets games
are on wor.  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations

The Event:

* The Joliet Mud Turtles, a Chicago land four wheel drive club, is
  sponsoring an On/Off Road Rally Sunday April 25th.

* For those who ask ""What is an on/off road rally?"", well...

  An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:

   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points
      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.

   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half
      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will
      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified

Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 85

#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade:		I (B)

It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had
only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he
has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... Peter Ahola.

#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
Grade:		I (B)

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high
expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be
Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.

#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,
he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (?)

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.
Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+)

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours
truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (D+/D)

He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is
quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.

That figure (1/4"") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12"").

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to ""factory-spec"" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15"" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a ""perfect"" monitor
(the definition of ""perfect"" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).

>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was ""normal""). The short answer is no, don't accept these
""imperfections"" as ""normal"" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N
(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess
if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
be worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly
neighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for
$1.29.

   These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player.  The
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal Laserdisc movies on it as well.  I have one which I
will sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one
complete system or $500 if you buy both systems.
 
    I currently run this into my entertainment center.  I have
it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan, and 
power supply.  I run the audio into my stereo system, and the
laserdisc runs directly into the T.V..  I have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons.  First person who buys both
games will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.
 
    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.
 
    Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an
RS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them.
 
    If you are interested please email me.

	Hate to be simple minded about this Tim, but I think its
really very simple.  He was a dirty Jew.  And the only good Jew, in
some peoples mind, is a dead Jew.  Thats what 40 years of propaganda
that fails to discriminate between Jew and Zionist will do.  Thats
what 20 years of statements like the ones I've appended will do to
someones mind.  They make people sick.  They drag down political
discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way
to resolve a dispute.

	What else can come of such demagogery?  Peace?

Arafat on the massacre at Tienamin Square:

	``...  on behalf of the Arab Palestinian People, their
        leadership, and myself...  [I] take this opportunity to express
        extreme gratification that you were able to restore normal order
        after the recent incidents in People's China.''

Yassir Arafat, humanitarian:

       ``Open fire on the new Jewish immigrants ...  be they from the
       Soviet Union, Ethiopia, or anywhere else.  It would be a disgrace if
       we did not lift a finger while herds of immigrants settle our
       territory.  I want you to shoot...  It makes no difference if they
       live in Jaffa or Jericho.  I give you explicit orders to open fire.

	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the
fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the
historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.

	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
latrines.

	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city.

	Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe
monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and
OS/2.)

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or
this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the
signature).

Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've
collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision
of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows
with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files
will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have
worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not
anything resembling an officially supported set.

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:
1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can
   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in
   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).
2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of
   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.
3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability
   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking
   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play
   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable
   about what you're doing.
4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files
   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.
   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your
warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many
monitors.

Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually
c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation
diskette to change your adapter or settings.

Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  
You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.

Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS
files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.

Of course you should be able to write a DD 720Kb disk without
making any holes.

	With relays alone, you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear
the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few
thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which
drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices

I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my Gateway
486/33V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be 
fairly unreliable. In approx 3 cases out of 10, I have had the backup fail
at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.
Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the
DOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive,
get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)?
Any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over
and over again until it cooperates...

Subject: Jose Canseco's Swing - 1992 vs. 1986.
Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society
Distribution: na
Lines: 50

Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

Two approaches that I've used: Tofranil, 50 mg qhs, Naproxen 250mg bid.
The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting
the analgesic abuse Headache.  DHE IV infusions for about 3 days (in
hospital).  Cold turkey is the only way I think.  Tapering doesn't
help. I wouldn't know how you can do this without your doctor.  I haven't
seen anyone successfully do it alone.  Doesn't mean it can't be done.

He'd have to go a far ways to run things down as bad as Reagan and Bush

Of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother is

Similarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredients

The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version
was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used
today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)
orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit
under the shroud.

I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the
Proton.

Hello,
	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda
Civic Si.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not
too drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new
header.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give
me?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are there
any other comparines would make Honda parts.  

	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't
screw up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?
I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
difference.

	I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it
would be much harder on the engine.

E-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.
Thanks for any help you may have to offer!

Actually, it's HAPP, and some of their equipment can be found in the 
Parts Express catalog (1-800-338-0531).  They show switches for $2,
joysticks for $13 and trackballs for $80.  They also have pinball parts.

Good luck.

Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents
have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade 
from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif
consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the
color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would
undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it
ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.  

As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right
about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from 
those who don't know what it is.

Someone posted a list of x number of alleged Bible contradictions.  As Joslin

If you want a good list (quantity) - _When Critics Ask, A Popular Handbook On

Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something.
I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and 
then address Kermit's offering.

John Redelfs originally wrote...

  jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It
  jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his

Tom Albrecht responded...

  ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.

John Redelfs wrote back that...

  jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.
  jr> Refer to John 14:2.

I responded to John that...

  rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.
  rw>
  rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved
  rw> may enter paradise.

To which Kermit wrote...

kt> Incomplete reference:

     I respond.

     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise
     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against 
     that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox
     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16), 
     the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).

     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent
     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was
     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the 
     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of 
     the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.
     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.

If you can use 386bsd:
	there is xview3 (OpenLook)

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via e-mail
		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.

	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received
	packets/seconds.


	Hope this helps,
	Amancio Hasty

Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.
(The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it.

It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.

>My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to

If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was
""Pitching and defense win championships"", and later ""Pitching is the essence
of baseball"".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was ""your 
point"", and neither of which is true.

And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?

It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-
scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

>They should have many 
>low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
>On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,

I thought you said ""pitching and defense win championships"" and ""pitching is
the essence of baseball"".

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be
the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. 
So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from

if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance

being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.

Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and
I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of
error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with
the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa
are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly
proscribed by the Qur'an.

I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the
fire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_
started the fire.

From my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.

>ALL buildings are aflame. NO ONE HAS ESCAPED. I think it obvious that

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

>napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
in Texas.  It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
stove to ignite the ""napalm"" when the stove would probably not be in use.  And 
I doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

In short Mr. Gorman (I am assuming Mr. as a title because I don't think a woman
would be stupid enough to make this post) I don't know what episode of CNN you
were watching but it obviously was not the same one that I was watching or your
tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye sight.

Please excuse any mispelled words as I am a product of the Arkansas education
system which Slick Willie of the ""Double Bubba Ticket"" has so greately improved
during his tenour as Governer of my great state (taking it from 49th in the 
nation in 1980 and allowing it to drop to 51st, how I don't know, and bringing
it to 44st and back to either 48th or 49th in 1990--sorry I can't rember the 
source of these numbers but they can be found).

I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered
by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!

As for the picks
Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will 
go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would
take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.

San Jose will then get Kariya.

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

   - Chris Gratton
   - Chris Pridham
   - a swedish player who I can't remember his name

Draft Order
-----------
1) Ottawa
2) San Jose
3) Tampa Bay
4) South Florida or Anahiem
5) South Florida or Anahiem
6) Hartford
7) Edmonton
8) Dallas
9) NY Rangers
10) Philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here
and am guessing 

(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going #1)

 A cash award is OK. A time limit would be nice. You can't give away

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for

The last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of
soc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
Josh McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd sense
of history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who were
mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
today? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone in
the medieval period ""knew the rules"" it was a matter of uncritically
accepting what they were told.

And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over

In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what
I meant by ""There is no way out of the loop"".  I wrote that human brains ""are
infested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.

In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:

> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience

Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your
conscience is properly formed?

The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the
formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure
that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation
can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll
grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.

Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be
certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is
`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)


Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:

> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the
> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          
> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.

The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?
How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or
another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?

You write:

> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our
> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our
> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas
> not subject to the experimental method. 

But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to
distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am
confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way
from `confident'.

This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain
(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is
significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that
you are confident, that invites people to ask why.

Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely
certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any
idea of his own fallibility.


I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of
truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of
them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.
The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.


Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu

[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the
original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster
regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong
answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal
consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is
at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that
-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are
fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these
basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's
unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of
confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as
to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for
example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,
and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a
feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and
intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's
some chance I'm wrong.

Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant
Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least
some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.
If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for
certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I
think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that
way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most
difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what
I think is the truth.

What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

What I like about GUI's:

	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...

	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time.

	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.
	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience.


What I hate about GUI's:

	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess
	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), 
BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE
and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two
afternoon games.

Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.

Execute the juvi on the grounds of the reformatory, required attendendence

   Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will
automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high
IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. 
   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1
on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of
the interrupts in between. Works just great.
   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the
higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the 

first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- 
especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no
problems.

Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how* 
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40' or fight 
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Fishing rights...small potatoes.

Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a
percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries
too, are all measures of size.  In this case I'd say the relevant
statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to
total casualties from among the total civilian population in the
affected geographical area.

Western news in general, but in particular the American ""mass media"":
CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole
war was one of ""those poor, poor Iraqis"" along with ""look how precisely
this cruise missile blew this building to bits"".

Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy
to say from our ""enlightened"" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back
then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.
After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of 
thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and 
millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and 
other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All 
things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were
essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick
end to avoid even greater allied losses.

I, for one, don't regret it.

Sure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more
reason to depose these ""entrenched political rulers operating in their
own selfish interests""!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies
as well??

I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the
West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,
misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and 
threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's
oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been
prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West
before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is
responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a
strong response from the West was required.

Well, it's not very ""loving"" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up
nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass
slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to
say yes, stopping Hussein was the most ""loving"" thing to do for the
most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.

I mentioned it.

If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would
have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned
in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take
Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting
Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to
protect Saudi Arabia.

So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American

This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.

I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution
nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to
the silence of the principals.

OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.
And frankly, the original ""not guilty"" verdict baffled me too.  But then
I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict
on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably
would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated
assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which
news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California
law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that 
the first jury decided that the officers were ""not guilty"".  Note, 
not ""not guilty"" of doing wrong, but ""not guilty"" of aggravated assault 
with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the 
prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a 
verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.

If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then
I feel the ""not guilty"" verdict was a reasonable one.

In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed ""movies"".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale ""movie"" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the ""movies"" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?""

""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.""
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  

Just my 2 cent.

Hi,
  
  I'm writing a science fiction script and I'm looking for some
answers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth. My starting point
is an impossible situation.  [I checked with a professor at berkeley
and his response was a VERY helpful ""can't happen"".] If you enjoy
playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions
please contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com).

  I get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic
facts about computers that I'm determined to be as scientifically
accurate as I can.


  Sorry for being vague, but I'd like to protect my idea as much as I
can until I'm ready to sell it (hopefully).

			  While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen
a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it
through which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the
2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel
kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650.
The external unit may be a better deal after all.

I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get
a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.

If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040.

Any takers?  

Supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the
demand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number.
I will pay shipping, of course.

All offers should be send to lewallen@cis.ohio-state.edu

I hope you don't find me arrogant, then.  This sounds like a bad practice --

Interesting... after several hours worth of exposure, do you still posess
the presence of mind to be able to determine how to escape from an inferno
surrounding you?  In other words, is it possible that the prolonged gassing
disoriented the wackos enough that possibility of escape was rendered
questionable?

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the
#1 spot.

>Gonzales, Rene       .685  ----  ----  ----  ----   0.685
It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first
and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points
higher in both leagues than any other year.

>Leius, Scott         ----  ----  ----  .653  .680   0.672
Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.

The other elite fielders in the league.

>Pagliarulo, Mike     .631  ----  .575  .744  ----   0.649
This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.
His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of
that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the
Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and
judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647
Add another to the elite fielders list.

>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642
>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642
Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know
what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low
1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988
(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.

>Buechele, Steve      .647  .616  .647  .681  .599   0.635
Strange last two years.

>Schmidt, Mike        .628  ----  ----  ----  ----   0.628
According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.
But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).

>Boggs, Wade          .643  .659  .550  .653  .634   0.626
Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every
other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.

>Martinez, Egdar      ----  ----  .621  .645  .599   0.624
Last year -- a fluke or a portent?

>*AL Average*         .641  .612  .604  .620  .602   0.615
Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close

>Jacoby, Brook        .624  .621  .600  ----  .597   0.613
Brook  is declining.

>Magadan, Dave        ----  ----  ----  ----  .609   0.609
>Jefferies, Greg      ----  ----  ----  ----  .606   0.606
Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder
at third.

>Zeile, Todd          ----  ----  ----  .614  .593   0.605
Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about
10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry
Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.

>Baerga, Carlos       ----  ----  ----  .604  ----   0.604
Moving back to second was a good idea.

>Hayes, Chris         ----  .601  .622  .606  .574   0.602
So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total
of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.

>Johnson, Howard      .628  .549  .611  .573  ----   0.588
>Lansford, Carney     .620  .578  .594  ----  .550   0.587
Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,
HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break
the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.

>Hollins, Dave        ----  ----  ----  ----  .577   0.577
Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.

>Sheffield, Gary      ----  ----  .584  ----  .567   0.575
Not a good fielder.

>Blauser, Jeff        ----  .573  ----  ----  ----   0.573
>Fryman, Travis       ----  ----  ----  .571  ----   0.571
Both are better off at shortstop.

>Gomez, Lee           ----  ----  ----  .551  .542   0.546
Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to
have helped his fielding any.

Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width. 
	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

Hope this helps.

No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.  I've never seen a guy who

Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges

	I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple
strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a
tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?

	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore
the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer
is the only way to go...

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)
The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out
there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)

My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper
systems.  If not we're in trouble.

Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like
to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.
They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken
seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know
little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step
in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning
or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the ""Clipper"" system is easily
justified ""Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying
to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative
so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.""
How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing
law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system
the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration
knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for
drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.

Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.
Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations
collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.

Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,
and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the
stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the
hell would they jump the gun?

I really wonder.

To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:

The White House
Office of the Press Secretary c/o:
Presidential Comment Line (fax)
(202) 456-2461
 
April 17, 1993
 
Sir and/or Madam:
 
 
I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and
cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.
 
It is apparent to me that those who drafted the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the ""Big Brother Proposal"") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep





ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from ""experts"" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.
 
In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how ""tamper proof"" the key escrows might be.
 
I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti





lize the ""Big Brother Chip.""
 
Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like ""harmony,"" ""right to encryption,"" and ""voluntary.""
 
It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is ""I can't believe it's happening here.""  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; ""When is the Reichstag fire planned for?""

When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I
believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.  It comes with instruction for
installation and requires no soldering.  Worked like a charm.  I think the
manufacturer is Mobius.

    The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a
    utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle
    the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.

    The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a
    palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette
    first (which creates a ""ram:picpal"" file), and then convert the
    .CLP files.

I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then

heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more
carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke.

Unfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year,
someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version
of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English
translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A
few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster
advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.
Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV.
The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many
might think.

Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,
nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:

a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several
1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800
miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.
No problems with winds and curves. 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where
we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.

b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see
no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip
back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind
you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still
get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.

Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well
expect the sucker to last 300k miles.

Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not

As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't

Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle
a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up?

Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,
check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.

I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can
be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted
files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.
Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.
Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was
under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.

All utilities available to me report no problems.
DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever
on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run
6 to 8 times.

Thanks.

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
any of the outlet boxes).

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic

The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.

Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?

I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard

dealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, ""I might as well spring the

My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :

   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   There will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip, like it or not.

   If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the

   would make ""compatible crypto chips for which no key had been

Yeah.  Sounds typical.  Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,
and therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when
acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I 
imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,
and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in 
medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI
machine which places extra demands on the data bus.

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

Subject: Himmler's speech on the extirpation of the Jewish race
Lines: 42
Nntp-Posting-Host: euclid.ucsd.edu


 WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the
Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules.""
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation""
or ""tearing up by the roots.""
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives
officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the
Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They
aren't bright enough to (typically) see by without the brake and tail
lights.

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in.


If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.

Hi all,

I really thought that by now I would have seen something
about this, but I haven't, so here goes:  Last night on
the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the
effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  There
was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson
did say something about a NASA official commenting that
there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.

Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
better than mine heard anything about this?  It seems rather
weird.

Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5
nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!

The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally
somewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.

>What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous
""sonic estimator"" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty 
cheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling
for something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )

This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft
admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver,
but I've found it to be pretty generic.

You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold
in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of
pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts
instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able
to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your
printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a
different value.

The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that
might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not
smiling.)

But what is Hasan B. Multu's middle name?  I'm not sure, but I heard

I want this man to tell me how in the hell you can take the 
explosives used in the WTC bombing, considering that the 
consensus seems to be that the explosive was a fertilizer-based
one.  Ammonium nitrate, to be exact . . . of which about
90,000 tons disappears per year (if I recall the stat correctly;

Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that
is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents,
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found.  No ground connection
is needed for it to function.

Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use

Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew (who converted).  

Lowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana's only representative to the
major leagues.

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone,
Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the
one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach,
that's quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt,
the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.

Is Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a ""Dave Cohen"" kinda misinterpretation?
Whatever, doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long.

I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed with
the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the
new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for
large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).

Until now.

This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had to
reboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.
When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.

I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.

P.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should

"From: chongo@toad.com (Landon C. Noll)
Subject: Reposting: 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules (2 of 2)
Expires: 8 May 93 00:00:00 GMT
Reply-To: chongo@toad.com (Landon C. Noll)
Distribution: world
Organization: Nebula Consultants in San Francisco
Lines: 1409
Keywords: ioccc

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines.
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

X * WARNING:
X *
X * This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every attempt
X * has been made to make sure that this program produces an entry that
X * conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, where this program
X * differs from the contest rules, the contest rules will be used.  Be
X * sure to check with the contest rules before submitting an entry.
X *
X * FOR MORE INFORMATION:
X *
X *   You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:
X *
X *	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X *	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X *
X *   Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.
X *
X *  The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X *  year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X *  prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X *  above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X *
X *  One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:
X *
X *	host: ftp.uu.net	(192.48.96.9)
X *	user: anonymous
X *	pass: yourname@yourhost
X *	dir:  ~/pub/ioccc
X *
X *  As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email
X *  to the above address.  Please use the subject 'send YEAR winners',
X *  where YEAR is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.
X *
X * Because contest rules change from year to year, one should only use this
X * program for the year that it was intended.  Be sure that the RULE_YEAR
X * define below matches this current year.

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest
X
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X
X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X
X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:

X	dir:  ~/pub/ioccc
X
X    As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email
X    to the above address.  Please use the subject 'send YEAR winners',
X    where YEAR is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.

X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.

I must agree.  There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
already.  In addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories.

Also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
environment.

There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any ""built-in"" drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.

Good Luck

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

I don't like this comment about ""Typical"" thinking. You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well.

Hi.

The RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive, not collections of
spheres, cylinders and so on...
The 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded...

Please have a look at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory
pub/RTrace.
In pub/RTrace/tmp there are some demo images with high quality text.
All of them are called Text?.jpg (JPEG encoded). See them first and then

One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and
Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for
it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that
crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you
_have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly
under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward
a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the
platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative
sophistication) will win.

Hello, 

	way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written
by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level
6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon
regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function. I still
have the patches, however, I can no longer find the sources to which
they applied ;-). 

	I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to
where I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5?

Linares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player
defect first.

What a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all
teams, MLB won't let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to
me.

Except that MLB won't allow it, which is all I ever said.

Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal (38th)
and an assist.

This definitely bolsters Calgary's chances in the playoffs.

	Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization.

	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has
TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)
so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.
ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND
gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).

	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT
gates (with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist
with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding
it all out, then simplifying.

In cross-section, it has a five-sided appearance, so it probably really

    No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California
on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government
on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.

    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.
Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate
hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on
criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's
immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at
least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it
was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the
reasons this ON is still walking around free today.

This is nonsense. I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say
for sure that no Beduins were ""moved"" or harmed in any way. On the
contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them
now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are
quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university. There are
good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward 
hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

Hasn't enyone heard of a leader's recon?  This is when the leader of the

You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it
means.
Perhaps you should explain what you think ""science has it's basis
in values"" means. The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results. That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop

Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how
does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the
phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,
or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)

Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not
a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
security.

So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these
warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the
session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such
a bad idea ?

Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,
or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,

How do you know? Were you there?

While obviously Koresh was a nut case, the (typical) inability of the
government/media to get its story straight is quite disturbing. On
tuesday night, NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place
was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
building. The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians
setting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible
their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the
blaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
of the site because it was still too hot. So how did they KNOW they
didnt accidentally set the fire.

Sounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy
evidence to me.

Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting
ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out
of town (in NM).

As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work
on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital
prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for
another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with
major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a
set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.

Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of
this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next
year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

I'm looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  I need at least 
4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but I would
prefer 8 or more input channels.  Each channel needs to have at least a 
volume control.  I'll consider buying broken equipment.  The mixer needs 
to be fairly small (I haven't got a lot of space for it).

OK, I should have said ""former"" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun?

Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does
happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to
help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them.

Then their's the ideological point.  We want to ""win"" Russia over to
our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances?

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia,
expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,
and probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government
is more key than how democratic it is.

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would
your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose

I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  Clinton didn't

been working on it for years.  While it's possible that Denning (and
other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a

Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory
(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the

Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead

Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and
reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that
need to be updated.  My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is
that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little
or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of
these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most
people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take
the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to
get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity
included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand
this.

And what if the original poster, Pixie, is never ""converted?""
Does it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity
for that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many 
Christians believe?  It makes more sense to me that rather
than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no
life for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself
what is best.  

--------------------------------------------

[You may be right about Christians relying on clergy, but I have some
reason to hope you're not.  Protestants emphasize conversion,
experience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intended
to make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own,
and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and
other Christians.  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but I
believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat
what they are told.  I admit that this isn't always successful -- we
certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents
expect it.  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing to
make judgements for themselves, and have a commitment that comes out
of their own experience.  Unfortunately, it's the nature of Usenet
that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized, so it looks like we spend
most of our time dealing with doctrine.  That's certainly not my
experience of the way Christians really live.  --clh]

I just mailed this:

I noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR.
The cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.
My questions are:
1. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away?
and
2. If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are?

To the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?

Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
but a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal
arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence.

So what's the deal with Bill Wirtz? Apparently, the Blackhawks - St.
Louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the Hawks
reported the attendace as 16,199. Gee, I wonder if Wirtz is planning to
use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of TV?
What a schmuck.

In other TV news, the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3
fewer broadcast TV games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of
subscription / pay-per-view system. Yuck.

Hi,

Can anybody suggest robust algorithms/code for computing the point of intersection
on n, 2-d lines in a plane. The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
technique does not seem to provide satifactory results.

Please respond by e-mail and I will post the summary to the newsgroups

Oh, you foolish person.  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents:  safer, cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically; etc, etc

If you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into
why - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research.

Making you look bad is too damn easy.  The vast social and historical
differences between alcohol and other drugs make this comparison

       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  
all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  
while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  
give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
of Yankee domination.

MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to

McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X

        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern
California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last
Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)
rocket ship.

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in
mid-June.

        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60
million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a
follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies.

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent
changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as
a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.

        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,
said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters.

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better,
faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of
evolutionary technology developments.

        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a
little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said
the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our
parents' time.""

        ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand
on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said
lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be
crucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially.""

        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction
we're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's
Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't
sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""

        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.
Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,""
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency.

        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.

        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures,
companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'
senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government
investments.""

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas
Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope""
of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle
take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to
5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000
feet.

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final
tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete""
Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated
check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.

        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will
become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on
throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround.

        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ
tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.

        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has
a technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible
for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog
multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run
from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic
inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity
amplifier:

                 +-----/\/\/\-------+
                 |                  |
                 |    /--------\    |
INPUT -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |
       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT
       +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |
                 |    \--------/
                 |
CONTROL	---------X (analog switch)
                 |
                 |
                ---
                GND

All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,
the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is
non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
up as carrier feed-through).

For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?

I hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).

The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include:

Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have
to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of
radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)
that make attitude control and docking a big pain.

If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with
current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted
by international treaty.

You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation
to do docking or    ( and refueling) .

You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!

The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose
they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and
the problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to
do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.

Definately, I agree wholeheartedly.  If they can build the amp where

  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier - as Adcom has done.

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.  Solid
older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  Without

postage.

I'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for 
excellent drafting machine construction! :-)
It's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted 
the typical office grey popular in that period.  It's smooth working, and 
each of the two ""arms"" on it measures roughly 24"".  It has a dual clamp to 
enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.

I no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something
like ""no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area 
immediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the
vagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva"".  

That is, abstinence wasn't discussed as ""sex outside of marriage is
morally wrong"" but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception 
is impossible. The moral question I recall the teacher asking was,
""is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent
yet?""

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.

There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the

the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance.  The ""aura"" was caused by direct

Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output
V6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point
harness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is 
up to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then
why is that? No flamage, just curiousity.

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says ""eight hours, bottle
to throttle"" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify
a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

BTW, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will
keep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  Coffee, hyperventilation
and other bar tricks won't speed it up nor will they fool Mr. Ranger.

[Apologies for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it
may not be in the newsfeed here.]

There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible
from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.

First, note that the ""experts"" will only look at ""details"", and of just 
the algorithm:

    In addition, respected experts from outside the
    government will be offered access to the confidential details of
    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
    their findings.

Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to
encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier
to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might
effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for ""voice-

And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should

Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on
the Cards.

  Not with a hub cap but one of those ""Lumber yard delivery
trucks"" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a ""Path"" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in
front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in

I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system.

What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
their quality and performance.

My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and
1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity.

So far, I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity
floptical drives.  Are there any comments/recommendations for either of these?

Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc).

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)
Organization: Adobe Systems Incorporated
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 79


I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one
may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than
an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)

   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able
to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't
tried this, but that would be my guess...

				anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com


...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and
beyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...

Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.

If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.

Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the Clipper Chip.

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,
would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

We are opposing, charging the bunker.  We should be nimble and clever.
The gov is strong, not clever.

Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, 
""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so 
as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.

An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is
chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves. You might notice that
many of the natives have wads in their mouths... the tea can be obtained in S.
American pharmacies. This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness and
dizziness - but don't try to jog with it. I've tried this when travelling and
hiking in Peru and Ecuador. The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minute
to cause any highs...

Also it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes.

For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 3.1 will support it. 
both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of

0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
""0"" for output, ""1"" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things.

	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.
Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?

	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is
based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up.  

	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
somewhere with our discussions.

Subject: proof of resurection
Organization: Social Science Computing
Lines: 44

I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of 
Christ's resurrection.  

First the scriptural quotations:

This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,
if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most
of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would
try to justify their own positions.

Second the logical proof:

 The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger
does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact
the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.

Finally:

There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits
communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief
without logical proof.  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for
rational western man, myself included.

I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a 
rejection of the resurrection's occurance.  I beleive, but I wanted to point 
out the weakness of logical proofs.

This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that
we've just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day's worth
of games pulled everything back to close to average.

Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more
runs scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine.

    CAREERS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY

    In 1990 the Princeton Planetary Society published the first edition of
    ""Space Jobs: The Guide to Careers in Space-Related Fields."" The
    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to
    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in
    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to
    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second
    edition of the guide.

    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job
    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of
    ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and
    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and
    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate
    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an
    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as
    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial
    organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find ""your"" star. These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be
    able to see ""your"" star without binoculars or a telescope. See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info; one such organization may be found at:

	""Fusion as Electric Propulsion"", Robert W. Bussard, Journal of

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values
	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""
	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a
	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows
	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
	    Earth/moon space.

	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion
	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch

	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by
	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.

	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob
	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently
	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one
	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid
	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]

I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of it,
and it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  First, it points to the
necessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are
all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed out 
before, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One       
person's ""make-believe"" can easily be another person's reality.  Using 
psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one
person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on
an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going
to happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my
point- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG
perceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those
affects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that
leads to the study being done.

I remember reading somewhere (QEMM manual, I think) that 
STACK=9,256 is needed only for the Windows SETUP program.  
Otherwise, use STACK=0,0.

Data should be e-mailed to me.

I *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back
in 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he
wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!
No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)

I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the
Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never
forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net
goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din
""Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!""  It sounds stupid, but that
early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then
I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened
by Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.

	I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think
you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM
+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common
I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.
I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference.

	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
specs. if the system uses that.

You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,
and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's
away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,
then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two
seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!

Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I
want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly
sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite
AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:

	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike
	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
	  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20
	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
	  being reported on WIP.

	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss
	  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about 
fighting my ticket.

Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your 
case in court.  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge 
about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lost
because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness.

Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called ""Fight Your Ticket"".

The general theme from those who said ""go for it"", was to be prepared.  
I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, 
transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may 
have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,
and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp>

A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might 
trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his day
off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.

One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if he
says I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.

Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.

Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.  I'll let you know what
happens after the big day!

This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed
above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran. It does not, of
course. These are expensive add-ons that drive the price WAY beyond $70.
( I don't know if the same applies to OS/2 )

As far as unix is concerned;
There is a free unix, linux, that has cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ),
Xwindows and many other features besides, with a large number of utilities
that can be optionally added. And there is also a free 386BSD I believe.
Both these unix's are quite robust. You can check out comp.os.linux

If you don't want to ""throw our many down the tubes"", you've got to break
that list down a little more.

Hello,

	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  
appreciated.

Subject: Buick heater controls
Summary: My air vents don't work on my 71 Skylark
Distribution: usa
Organization: Purdue University Physics Department
Lines: 31

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if
it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these
Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is
stuck in the ""vent"" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't 
live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

Two questions:

	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?

	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
	a way to ""fix"" this?

THanks for any advice/info

                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE

[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- 
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with 
the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]

Dear Adrian:  

I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to 
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and 
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist 
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back 
with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present 
now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the 
future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  

There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger 
of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 
10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, 
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic 
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll 
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent 
with your note.  

First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't 
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my 
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  

Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't 
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions 
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older 
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  

Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on 
countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND 
BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this 
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  

Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat 
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you 
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in 
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our 
ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree 
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  
More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s 
clearly indicate the contrary.  

Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human 
behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The 
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the 
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  

Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates 
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but 
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social 
benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a 
criminal offense.  

Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials 
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are 
many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless 
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it 
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that 
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, 
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's 
permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists 
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed 
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  
Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" 
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, 
ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in 
the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, 
and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we 
probably manufacture at least that many every year.

The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly 
aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what 
their real motives are.  

Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, 
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; 
the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the 
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing 
this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a 
quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" 
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna 
be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.

As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law 
provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I 
will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is 
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands 
-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can 
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given 
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics 
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  

So what's the point?

Oh, yes.  Definitely.  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens.

Don't give me that shit.  If Boston had Alomar, Olerud, Henke, and
Ward while Toronto had Rivera, Jack Clark, Jeff Reardon, things would
have looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is

I'm willing to bet they don't finish sixth.  I'm also willing to bet

bet that they finish ahead of the Blue Jays.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in ""entrapment"" (the users would send thier key anyway
	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?

	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...

Subject: Do the 2MB ATI Ultra Pro 16 and 24 bit Windows Drivers Work?
Organization: University of Texas at Austin
Lines: 35

Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,
and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it
was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply
amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers
for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been
running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have
tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:
""Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.""  Anyway, I
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

The system configuration is:

Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus
16 Megs Ram
SCSI HD & CD-ROM
Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller
ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM
DOS 6.0
Windows 3.1
Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)

Thanks in advance.

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".

Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'

Any info on that?

In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?

Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them

I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

My Problem: I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an *SCSI*-CD-ROM for
Windows NT when ordering the Beta-SDK-Package. So my question: Is there any driver
available that will allow me to use my Mitsumi (Non-SCSI) CD-ROM for installation ?
If there is one, from which place (ftp-site) can I get it ?

Many thanks in advance

Subject: Insurance discount
Summary: Two or more vehicles... discount?
Organization: Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, Tucson AZ.
Lines: 26

Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They
do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...
accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson
they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,
per annum.

Muchas gracias,
			Enrique

	No, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else
devise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW: the DOE handles
reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these
reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has
none of these official sources.

	So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics
aside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer
is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can
see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?

>Of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material

	Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have
been lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs
than trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of
a device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

To:  shaig@Think.COM

Subject: Ten questions to Israelis

Dear Shai,

Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.

In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of
Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have
received from other quarters, according to which there are two
distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship
(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports
etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I
am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all
times and present them at many public places, almost every day.
These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.
You maintain that this mainly because of religious services
provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?
Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it
serves no other purpose ?

In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that
Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were
'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I
read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had
plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into
Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of
Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was
established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for
later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the
fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the
land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God
promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the
borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use
today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what
it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a
base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one
cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a
number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).

Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public
official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to
Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without
evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said
the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why
should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.

Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning
'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from
Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do
exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?

You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a
way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been
used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet
Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they
would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are
clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be
very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about
Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.
I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest
discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.

I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.

ARGHHHHHHHHHh

READ THE MEMOS!!!!

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES from the SAME RESTAURANT and the people that
ordered the food for me did NOT TELL ME which time the MSG was in the
food and which time it was not in the food.

ONE TIME I HAD A REACTION

ONE TIME I DID NOT

THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD

THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

SAME RESTAURANT - SAME INGREDIENTS!!!

>Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
>normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately
>conclude that any negative reaction is to the MSG? 

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG)

I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

If you're having trouble understand this, please tell me which of the
words you do not understand and I'll look them up in the dictionary
for you.

That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame-
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average
european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better 
skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL
are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league
game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many 
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen.

I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars
aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans
are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the
class of his own).

I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere
unless they are greatly exaggerated.  Even the equatorial bulge is only
about 1 part in 300 -- you'd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe --
and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller.

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the
details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please
correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise.  They

Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.  There are
two parts to the security of such a system:
  
    (a) Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    (b) Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.

Of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about
(a) and very little about (b).

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first GM to ""waste"" high draft choices
on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,
and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more
years in his prime.

	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It
seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions
prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.

	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children.

	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.

	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the
Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

[...]

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.

   [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.
	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand.
	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.
	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward.

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.
	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health.
	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine.""

Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming
that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated
by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a
complaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for
Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions.

For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does
not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.
Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.

I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the
East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

	I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although
they were not great players themselves.  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize
what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.  
 
>The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.  All of the aforemen-

	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say
that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy
individual (from what I have heard). 

	Also, isn't the point of ""professional"" hockey to make money
for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

Are we going to ""make do without"" like the people in New York City? 
You know New York City: That gun ban utopia you dream about, with
the millions of unregistered handguns?  New York City, by the way,
has a very high crime rate.

Perhaps you should know about a gungrabber's nightmare - Idaho.
Here in Idaho, the police give concealed carry permits to anyone
over 21 without a criminal record.  There are no gungrabber schemes
such as FOIDs, waiting periods, ""gun a month,"" or LTCs.  And horror
of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed
weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit
for concealed carry in an automobile).

I feel a hell of a lot safer in Boise than I would in your gun ban
dream state (e.g., Washington, D.C.).

>The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against

The voting public in Idaho is staunchly pro-gun.  Both senators

	Waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  The population temporarily

I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the
world. They were 'our' grandparents who were cold-bloodedly exterminated
by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920, not yours. And you can always
participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish 
and Kurdish people on April 23, 1993 in the United States and Canada. 

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- We also demand that the United States return to the policies 
advocated by U.S. Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen,
who have undertaken a just, human and benevolent attitude towards 
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

""Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops 
 surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six 
 or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just 
 bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  But they 
 attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
 Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
 way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the 
 way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said.  His daughter was killed in the 
 battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road.""

As much as I considered some of the (so-called) Islam-related dialogue
here a total waste of time, I somehow can't restrain myself in this
instance, so, Gregg, try this:

20:52 P.S.T.  I come to my senses and accept the all-knowing
wisdom and power of the Quran and Allah.  Not only that, but Allah 
himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice. Allah rolls a
few bones and we get down.  Then Allah gets out the Crisco, bends 
over, and invites me to take a spin around the block.  Wow.

20:56 P.S.T.  I realize that maybe Allah is looking for more of a 
commitment than I'm ready for, so I say ""Man, I've got some
programming to do.  Gotta go.  I'll call you.""

20:59 P.S.T   Thinking it over, I renounce Islam.

BTW, Gregg, Allah said he still thinks of you.

Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.

Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the
head and your wallet, with your insurance card, is stolen.  This happened to 
me, and it took six months to sort the mess out.  These sorts of plans sound
nice at first, but in the end they just create a lot of paperwork and

[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.

I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with 
that) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).

I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers
then a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. 

The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior
Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of

Subject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?
Organization: USC  Department of Computer Science

Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel ""puffy"", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

I am under the impression that MSG ""enhances"" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.

Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
Input boxes for the keyboards.  These are the little boxes that take a
line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the run
to the mixer.  Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm going
to need like 5 or 10 of them!  I looked inside one (belonging to
another band) and it looks like just a transformer.  Does anyone have
any plans for building them?  Perhaps in Anderton's ""Electronic

tracking down...)?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: Disappearing hard drive in LC?
Organization: CONCERT-CONNECT -- Public Access UNIX
Lines: 31

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to
hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system
7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated
chain.

I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes
have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking
question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed
okay, but there was no sign of the internal.

I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot
from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire
about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in
trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it
is a Quantum... )

Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I
noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that
all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.

But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD
or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.

And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I
can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed
there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and
that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.

Thanks for answers.

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.  

Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use?

Are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
Anyway, I think that ""revenge"" or ""fairness"" is why most people are in
favor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished, people
that think that he should ""get what he deserves.""  Most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the

Where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  If
someone wrongs me, I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills
another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?

Or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
never be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.

Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.

And, you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  Shouldn't we,
by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?

In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a
court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal
wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the
system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?

The second section shows the sequence of events.
The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the
line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope
with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are
talking analogue telephony here).
What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?
Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?
I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the
same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not
be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later
it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units
(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.

How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed
for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone
line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised
speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to
add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect
anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body
called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know
if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.
Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get
to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.

and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a
cop ""seeing"" me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but
""he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone"" is not ""beyond a

	There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is 
important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his 
garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).

	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:

	- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
	- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense

	- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.

	In any case, who cares?

Hi!

I don't know much about Mormons, and I want to know about serious independent
studies about the Book of Mormon.

I don't buy the 'official' story about the gold original taken to heaven,
but haven't read the Book of Mormon by myself (I have to much work learning
Biblical Hebrew), I will appreciate any comment about the results of study
in style, vocabulary, place-names, internal consistency, and so on.

For example: There is evidence for one-writer or multiple writers?
There are some mention about events, places, or historical persons later
discovered by archeologist?

Yours in Collen

          The Sophomore
          (Romans 1:22)

The sophomore says, ``What is truth?''
and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers.

How modern how daring how liberating
How modern how daring how liberating
they chant

The sophomore, being American
Doesn't know
That his ``question''

   modern
       skeptical
           cynical

Was asked before, by a

   modern
       skeptical
           cynical
   urbane cosmopolitan

Politician (appointed not elected)
Who happened to live two thousand years ago.

Like many politicians he cared

    Less about ideals
         than results

    Less about ends
         than means

    Less about anything
         than keeping his job
              (and his head).

We might call him
A bit brutal
Though `firm' would be kinder
(And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness)
He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better
(Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).

And when these wily Jews
With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose
     conundrums
Brought forth their madman,
His first impulse was to play the Roman:
``I find nothing wrong with him,
  See to it yourselves.''

But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar'
His heart froze.

If he killed their madman
    He'd start a riot
         and lose his job
             (and his head)

If he saved the King of the Jews
    He'd piss off Caesar
         and lose his job
             (and his head)

And when his wife told him to have
   Nothing to do with the righteous lout
She didn't tell him anything
   He hadn't already figured out.

So he punted.

``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!''
(who just happened to be in town....)

Herod appreciated the courtesy
But wasn't worried
        And sent the sharp-tongued fool
     (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,
    funny how people lose it under pressure....)
  back
In the attire proper
  to his Royal State.

His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem,
Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king
of whatever world he wants
as long as it's not Caesar's.

``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout.
(Looks like he'll last this one out....)

The crowd's reaction puzzled him.
  They really wanted him dead.
They didn't want the King of the Jews,
  They wanted Barabbas instead
(And, as Josephus records, they got him)

Oh well, he thought,
They all look the same to me.
And we'll get Barabbas next time.

And if I can get them to say
   ``We have no king but Caesar!''
   By killing a madman,
Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

And then Pilate had his fun
  A little joke
    Short
      To the point
        Trilingual

And all this
Went as it always does
When someone gets caught
In the gears of government

And there's a scientific explanation
     (no doubt)
For the superstitious rumors
     (persisting to this day)
That it didn't all end
With a tomb
and a Roman squadron on guard.

Our sophomore doesn't know about this
He doesn't recognize his kindred spirit
(Or truth either, as he admits).

I guess we haven't learned much
in two thousand years.

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

above 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.

It made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.

Good luck on your quest.

Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin 
Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

It was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. Cost then 
was Pounds 5.95 in the UK, though I paid 18.50 for it in Canadian 
dollars. I have no idea whether it's still in print. Perhaps you could

* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?

  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted
  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A
  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone
  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.

  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis.

  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is
  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert
  ciphertext into plaintext.

  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The
  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,
  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different
  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.

  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,
  eavesdroppers, or third parties.

* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?

  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given
  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,
  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,
  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and
  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the mid-60's.

  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or
  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want
  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.

  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of
  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently
  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The
  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,
  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments
  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].

  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite
  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in
  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of
  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on
  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management
  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
  networks.

  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on
  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.

* How does one go about cryptanalysis?

  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern
  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available
  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series
  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for
  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given
  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still
  classified.

  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,
  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the
  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.

* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?

  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can
  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.

  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the
  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or
  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.
  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
  brute-force search is impractical.
    
  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years
  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with
  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic
  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel
  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.
  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].

  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.

* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?

  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.

  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The
  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is
  probably strong.

  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).
    
  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A
  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.

  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily
  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.
  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then
  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring
  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.

* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it
  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?

  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical
  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might
  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is
  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  doesn't have a chance.

  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,
  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even
  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See
  [KAH67].
  
* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break?

  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21""
with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.

The 4-bit server should work fine.  As far as I know, Xterminals

Hi there!

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a 14"" multisync (NEC 3D)?
The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and
vertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,
though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624
noninterlaced.
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
8bits/pixel, preferably more.

Is there anything on the market that comes even close?


Thanks

Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just
bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.

How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from
time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???

Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed? Save up for a
*really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save
my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

 curs_move = XCreateFontCursor (disp_data, XC_crosshair);

 geom_vals.foreground     = blck_pixl ^ grey_dark;
 geom_vals.plane_mask     = AllPlanes;
 geom_vals.line_width     = 0;
 geom_vals.function       = GXxor;
 geom_vals.subwindow_mode = IncludeInferiors;
 evnt_mask= GCForeground | GCPlaneMask | GCLineWidth | GCFunction
                                                     | GCSubwindowMode;
 geom_gcon= XCreateGC (disp_data, root_iden, evnt_mask, &geom_vals);



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic

/**********************************************************************/
 void Tselect::move_bands (int delt_xloc, int delt_yloc)          /****/

            XDrawRectangle (disp_data,   root_iden,  geom_gcon,

""Better than the status quo"" isn't good enough, I'd say. The same

Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of

Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.

>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.
This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown
much power yet, though.

>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.
How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's
Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe
it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as
well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.

>4. Russell is finishing well.
In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?

>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.
A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of
small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.

>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field
>and just as good at the plate)
Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the ""in the field"" part, and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll
be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little
luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,
Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).

See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like ""could run away with
the division"" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If
Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could
be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

Watch from where?  Two miles away?  Far enough away that whatever

a humiliated agency that said (quote!) ""Enough is enough.""

The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther King's wife insinuating
that MLK was having an affair!  Again, please tell us exactly
how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government.

I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to
risk small arms fire to get some good footage.  These people
were told to get the hell out of camera range.  Why?

Pardon the harshness that follows...

Once, I told a cradle christian: Please do not take advantage of Jesus
or anybody for the sake of your own (selfish) realization or search
for true faith/religion/belonging/'being in'/fear of hell/vanity/etc.  
Instead of serving yourself, _we must be serving Him_.  
*Until you have comprehended this truth, you are only doing things for your 
own egoism.*

Let us not use Jesus, our religion, the Bible, anything or
anybody as a means of escape or getting ecstatic or high.
We are God's children and we must have a true and authentic
relationship with our Father with obedience, faith, hope and 
love and works (the last as the most important).

Beware of our 'materialistic', 'worldly' and 'selfish' motives.  
Atheists have this ground against us and I believe they are right about
*some* who call themselves 'christians'.

Subject: R5 table widget causing trouble with XtQueryGeometry
Organization: Universitaet Koblenz
Lines: 227
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: glass.uni-koblenz.de

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5

	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).
	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error
	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the
	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 
	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).
	
	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about?

	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. 
	Germans are requested to answer in german.

Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who
""admitted to starting the fire"", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.
Today, ""a few saw someone starting a fire"" and ""our aerial surveillance
showed them starting fires"" at this morning's press conference. 
Tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. A reporter pointed out
that a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking
over lanterns started the fire. Curiouser and curiouser.

Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

Hello Buddy,

I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have
DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B"" 
	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That
	has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy
----------------------------------------------------------------
Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.
Dan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40
MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the
same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either
product.

   On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were ""invited"" to take the role of
Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the
liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so
therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but
to no avail.

   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem
is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of
innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any
decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to ""try
something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.

   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet
(""Who wants to get around people's feet,"" according to one of our
priests) the congregation was ""invited"" to come up and help wash one
another's hands.

   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to
participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with
rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. ""Body of Christ"" -- ""Amen""
for receiving Communion), that they could be ""I am not responsible for
the blood of this man.""

   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (""Blessed are You, God of
all creation..."") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The
priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to
others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion
that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up
prayers for our priests and parish).

   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be
celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would
still be ""liturgically"" beautiful.  The problem comes about from
people trying to be ""creative"" who are not.

   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that
given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by
the title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  ""They don't
want to"" because of all this nonsense.

   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does
not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are
disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own ""authority.""

I was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch.  Clutch?  Baerga?  The
two words simply do not go together.  With runners in scoring
position, Baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year.  This doesn't quite
*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.

Alomar?  He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!

The difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81
RBIs in 182 such AB.  Baerga got 25% more chances, yet succeeded only
20% more times.

Frankly, I don't believe in clutch.  But if I did, my vote would
go to Alomar for MVP (let alone ""best 2B in the AL"").

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. However in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed i.e.

void
SomeEventHandler(Widget w, XtPointer data, XEvent *event)
{
    /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */
    if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) {
        /* do some action */
    } else {

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You
wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that
is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk 
and act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing
to talk peace.

True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?

> 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't
you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have
patience.

Why not? Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR.
Murphy played 162 and hit 37.
In 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games.

I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX2000.  My car has 11,500
miles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91
model with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,
which my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair
deal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not
seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical
engine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's
engine is a little ""tight.""  So, if I buy the NX2000 and ""excercise"" it
well, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be
much appreciated.  Thanks.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.

You somehow missed Nabil's comments, even though you included it in
your followup:

I am not aware of ""killings between Jewish tribes"" in the desert.

The point of ""typical thinking"" here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY
act in the manner you describe, like ""any nomadic people occupying a 
land"", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have
somehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs
often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar
with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic
cleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  It is precisely this 
mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were
killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a
ludicrous suggestion.

If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible
ever say so.  It never comes right and says ""Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.""
        What Christ did say was :

        ""I solemly assure you, NO ONE can enter God's kingdom without
         being born of water and Spirit ... Do not be surprised that I
         tell you you must ALL be begotten from above.""

Could this be because everyone is born with original sin?
